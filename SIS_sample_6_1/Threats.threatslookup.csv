1,1,Residential & commercial development,yes,Threats from human settlements or other non-agricultural land uses with a substantial footprint,,
2,1.1,Housing & urban areas,yes,"Human cities, towns, and settlements including non-housing development typically integrated with housing","urban areas, suburbs, villages, ranchettes, vacation homes, shopping areas, offices, schools, hospitals, birds flying into windows, land reclamation or expanding human habitation that causes habitat degradation in riverine, estuary and coastal areas, etc.","This category obviously dovetails somewhat arbitrarily with 1.2 Commercial and Industrial Areas. As a general rule, however, if people live in the development, it should fall into this category."
3,1.2,Commercial & industrial areas,yes,Factories and other commercial centres,"military bases, factories, stand-alone shopping centres, office parks, power plants, train yards, ship yards, airports, landfills, etc.","Shipyards and airports fall into this category, whereas shipping lanes and flight paths fall under 4. Transportation & Service Corridors. Dams are NOT included here, rather they are in 7.2 Dams & Water Management/Use."
4,1.3,Tourism & recreation areas,yes?,Tourism and recreation sites with a substantial footprint,"ski areas, golf courses, resorts, cricket fields, county parks, afghan goat polo fields, campgrounds, coastal and estuarine tourist resorts, etc.","There is a fine line between housing and vacation housing/resorts. Be careful not to confuse this category, which focuses on the habitat effects of recreation areas, with those in 6.1 Recreational Activities, which focuses on the disturbance effects posed by recreation."
5,2,Agriculture & aquaculture,yes,"Threats from farming and ranching as a result of agricultural expansion and intensification, including silviculture, mariculture and aquaculture (includes the impacts of any fencing around farmed areas)",,"Threats resulting from the use of agrochemicals, rather than the direct conversion of land to agricultural use, should be included under 9.3 Agricultural & Forestry Effluents. Likewise in cases where conversion to agriculture causes increased run-off and hence sedimentation of rivers and lakes, that is also best treated under 9.3 Agricultural & Forestry Effluents."
6,2.1,Annual & perennial non-timber crops,yes,"Crops planted for food, fodder, fibre, fuel, or other uses",,"Select the appropriate scale of the farming activity and list the specific crop(s) e.g., wheat farms, sugar cane plantations, rice paddies, hillside rice production, household swidden plots, banana or pineapple plantations, mango or apple orchards, olive or date groves, vineyards, oil palm plantations, tea or coffee plantations, mixed agroforestry systems, coca plantations, etc."

11,2.2,Wood & pulp plantations,yes?,"Stands of trees planted for timber or fibre outside of natural forests, often with non-native species",,"If it is one or a couple timber species that are planted on a rotation cycle, it belongs here. If it is multiple species or enrichment plantings in a quasi-natural system, it belongs in 5.3 Logging & Wood Harvesting"
12,2.2.1,Small-holder plantations,no,,,
13,2.2.2,Agro-industry plantations,yes,,,
14,2.2.3,Scale Unknown/Unrecorded,no,,,
15,2.3,Livestock farming & ranching,yes,Domestic terrestrial animals raised in one location on farmed or non-local resources (farming); also domestic or semi-domesticated animals allowed to roam in the wild and supported by natural habitats (ranching),,"In farming, animals are kept in captivity; in ranching they are allowed to roam in wild habitats. If a few animals are mixed in a subsistence cropping system, it belongs in 2.1 Annual & Perennial Non-Timber Crops. Forage of wild resources for stall-fed animals falls under 5.2 Gathering Terrestrial Plants. Domesticated livestock that has gone feral should be treated under 8.1 Invasive Non-native/Alien Species, but other wild-roaming livestock may also require closer consideration to determine if they are best placed here or also under 8.1."
16,2.3.1,Nomadic grazing,no,"Pastoralists who are normally only present for part of the year, usually after good rains have improved the grazing.",,

Sediment or toxic chemical runoff from mining should be placed in 9.2 Industrial & Military Effluents if it is the major threat from a mining operation.
27,3.3,Renewable energy,no,,,
28,4,Transportation & service corridors,yes?,"This class includes transportation corridors outside of human settlements and industrial developments. These corridors create specific stresses to biodiversity including especially fragmentation of habitats and lead to other threats including farms, invasive species, and poachers.",,Threats from long narrow transport corridors and the vehicles that use them including associated wildlife mortality
29,4.1,Roads & railroads,yes?,Surface transport on roadways and dedicated tracks,"highways, secondary roads, primitive roads, logging roads, bridges & causeways, road kill, fencing associated with roads, freight/passenger/mining railroads, etc.","Off-road vehicles are treated in the appropriate category in 6.

32,4.4,Flight paths,no,Air and space transport,"flight paths, jets impacting birds, etc.",Airports fall into 1.2 Commercial & Industrial Areas.
33,5,Biological resource use,yes?,"Threats from consumptive use of ""wild"" biological resources including both deliberate and unintentional harvesting effects; also persecution or control of specific species",,"Consumptive use means that the resource is removed from the system or destroyed - multiple people cannot use the same resource, as they could under 6. Human Intrusions & Disturbance. Threats in the class can affect both target species (harvest of desired trees or fish species) as well as ""collateral damage"" to non-target species (trees damaged by felling or fisheries bycatch) and habitats (coral reefs destroyed by trawling). Persecution/control involves harming or killing species because they are considered undesirable. For some of the use threats there is an additional question on whether or not International trade is a significant driver of decline (5.1.1, 5.2.1, 5.3.1, 5.3.2, 5.4.1, 5.4.2)."
34,5.1,Hunting & trapping terrestrial animals,no,"Killing or trapping terrestrial wild animals or animal products for commercial, recreation, subsistence, research or cultural purposes, or for control/persecution reasons; includes accidental mortality/bycatch",,"This category focuses on animals that primarily live in a terrestrial environment. There are obviously some species that live on the terrestrial/aquatic boundary. Hunting otters, beavers, amphibians, polar bears, penguins, waterfowl, and sea birds should (somewhat arbitrarily) go here. Hunting seals, whales and other marine mammals, and freshwater and marine turtles go in 5.4 Fishing & Harvesting Aquatic Resources. Yes, most people ""gather"" honey, eggs, or insects or other slow moving targets, rather than ""hunt"" them. But for consistency it was decided to keep all animal products as being hunted. This option does not distinguish between small and large scale (unlike others below) as generally most hunting and collecting of animals is small scale, but arguably some hunting in the past was very large ""industrial"" scale."
35,5.1.1,Intentional use (species is the target),yes?,,"bushmeat hunting, trophy hunting, beaver trapping, butterfly collecting, honey or bird nest hunting, etc.",
36,5.1.2,Unintentional effects (species is not the target),yes?,,"pest control often impacts non-targeted species, hunter's dogs may chase after and kill other non-target species during a hunt, loss of a species' prey base due to over-harvesting by humans of their prey, etc.","For species unintentionally impacted the stress is usually coded as mortality, however, in the case of species' losing their prey base the stress would be coded as 2.3.8 Indirect Species Effects - Other."
37,5.1.3,Persecution/control,no,,"wolf control, pest control, persecution of snakes because of superstition, etc.",
38,5.1.4,Motivation Unknown/Unrecorded,no,,,"It is not known if the hunting or collection is intentional, unintentional or if it is persecution/control."
39,5.2,Gathering terrestrial plants,yes?,"Harvesting plants, fungi, and other non-timber/non-animal products for commercial, recreation, subsistence, research or cultural purposes, or for control reasons",,"This category focuses on plants, mushrooms, and other non-animal terrestrial species except trees which are treated in 5.3 Logging & Wood Harvesting."

43,5.2.4,Motivation Unknown/Unrecorded,yes?,,,"It is not known if the use is intentional, unintentional or if it is persecution/control."
44,5.3,Logging & wood harvesting,yes,"Harvesting trees and other woody vegetation for timber, fibre, or fuel",,"Felling trees to clear agricultural land goes in the appropriate category in 2. Agriculture & Aquaculture. If it is a few timber species that are planted on a rotation cycle, it belongs in 2.2 Wood & Pulp Plantations. If it is multiple species or enrichment plantings in a quasi-natural system, it belongs here."

56,5.4.6,Motivation Unknown/Unrecorded,no,,,
57,6,Human intrusions & disturbance,no,"Threats from human activities that alter, destroy and disturb habitats and species associated with non-consumptive uses of biological resources",,"Non-consumptive use means that the resource is not removed - multiple people can use the same resource (for example, birdwatching). These threats typically do not permanently destroy habitat except perhaps in extremely severe manifestations."
58,6.1,Recreational activities,yes?,"People spending time in nature or traveling in vehicles outside of established transport corridors, usually for recreational reasons","off-road vehicles, motorboats, motorcycles, jet-skis, snowmobiles, ultralight planes, dive boats, whale watching, mountain bikes, hikers, cross-country skiers, hangliders, birdwatchers, scuba divers, pets brought into recreation areas, temporary campsites, caving, rock-climbing, etc.",This category does not include work involving consumptive use of biodiversity - for example disturbance impacts from loggers or hunters would be in the appropriate category in 5. Biological Resource Use. Vehicles and boats in established transport corridors go in 4. Transportation & Service Corridors. The development of permanent recreational or tourist facilities (such as hotels and resorts) should be included under section 1.3 Tourism & Recreation Areas rather than here.

Permanent military bases should go under 1.2 Commercial & Industrial Areas. Other military activities might best be assigned to other categories. For example, hunting of specific animals by soldiers living off the land fits under 5.1 Hunting & Collecting Terrestrial Animals."
60,6.3,Work & other activities,no,People spending time in or traveling in natural environments for reasons other than recreation or military activities,"law enforcement, drug smugglers, illegal immigrants, species research, vandalism, etc.",
61,7,Natural system modifications,no,"Threats from actions that convert or degrade habitat in service of “managing” natural or semi-natural systems, often to improve human welfare",,"This category deals primarily with changes to natural processes such as fire, hydrology, and sedimentation, rather than land use. Thus it does not include threats relating to agriculture (which should be under 2. Agriculture & Aquaculture), or infrastructure (1. Residential & Commercial Development and 4. Transportation & Service Corridors)."
62,7.1,Fire & fire suppression,no,Suppression or increase in fire frequency and/or intensity outside of its natural range of variation,,"This category focuses on the human activities that lead to either not enough fire or too much fire in the ecosystem in question. If fire escapes from established agricultural lands, it belongs here, if fire is used to clear new agricultural lands, it belongs in the appropriate category in 2. Agriculture & Aquaculture. It also includes damaging ""natural"" fires in systems that have lost their natural resilience."
63,7.1.1,Increase in fire frequency/intensity,no,,"List the specific source of fire e.g., inappropriate fire management, escaped agricultural fires, arson, campfires, fires for hunting, etc.",

The latter is particularly relevant when former agricultural lands are abandoned.
79,8,"Invasive and other problematic species, genes & diseases",yes?,"Threats from non-native and native plants, animals, pathogens/microbes, or genetic materials that have or are predicted to have harmful effects on biodiversity following their introduction, spread and/or increase in abundance",,"After much deliberation it was decided to restrict the use of ""invasive species"" to refer to non-native species to keep things simple for policy makers. The term ""problematic native species"" is used instead to refer to native species that have become superabundant or otherwise cause problems. If possible, also record the source of the invasive species and/or conditions that exacerbate their effect. This is the class of threats that covers diseases. Where the Kingdom for a fungal disease is unknown, it should be coded under 8.1.1, 8.2.1 or 8.3.1 and the disease name should be noted in the text field."
80,8.1,Invasive non-native/alien species/diseases,yes,"Harmful plants, animals, pathogens and other microbes not originally found within the ecosystem(s) in question and directly or indirectly introduced and spread into it by human activities",,"We are defining non-native/alien/exotic species and diseases as those brought in either intentionally or accidentally by humans in the last 10,000 years. Note that for diseases, it is the infective agent which is considered to be the threat, with the disease being its manifestation in individuals. Domesticated livestock that has gone feral should be coded here, but there is a grey area concerning 'farmed' livestock which are allowed to roam wild; if these are rounded up periodically they could be considered ""farmed"" and coded under 2.3 Livestock Farming & Ranching, but if there is little to no management they might be better placed here."
81,8.1.1,Unspecified species,yes?,,,"Only to be used if it is known that there is a threat from an invasive, but the species involved have not been named or only named at a very general level - e.g. invasive plants, invasive animals, etc. There is a text box alongside the threat to provide further explanation/detail on this and some of the information might also be relevant for inclusion under the Threats narrative."

In addition, any taxon already in the taxonomic hierarchy in the SIS database (at whatever taxonomic-level) can be added as a named invasive via the ""Quick Add"" function. Note, if the named disease is caused by viruses or prions, option 8.5 should be used instead and there is a separate list of those ""organisms""."
83,8.2,Problematic native species/diseases,no,"Harmful plants, animals, or pathogens and other microbes that are originally found within the ecosystem(s) in question, but have become “out-of-balance” or “released” directly or indirectly due to human activities",,"It is a bit of a judgement call as to when a species becomes ""problematic"" (also referred to as species being ""outside its natural range of variation"").

90,8.5,Viral/prion-induced diseases,no,"Viruses are small infectious agents that replicate only inside the living cells of an organism. Although viruses occur universally, each cellular species has its own specific range that often infect only that species. Most viruses co-exist harmlessly in their host and cause no signs or symptoms of disease. However, a number are important pathogens which can result in diseases which significantly reduce reproduction or increase mortality.Prions are infectious agents composed of protein in a misfolded form. They do not contain nucleic acids. All known prion diseases affect the structure of the brain and other neural tissue, they are mainly found in mammals, are currently untreatable and are universally fatal.",,"The intention here is not to record all know viruses or prions recorded for the species being assessed, but only those that are thought to be having a negative impact on the species concerned.

93,8.6,Diseases of unknown cause,no,"Occasionally plants and animals are impacted by diseases of unknown origin and often it may take many years to identify the pathogen responsible. For example, it is not known what causes white-band disease (WBD) in Acroporid corals, but the disease is having a huge impact in some parts of the world.",,"This option will be used in cases where a disease has been described, but the pathogen responsible is not yet known. Once the pathogen is identified the records will need to be recoded accordingly."
94,9,Pollution,no,Threats from introduction of exotic and/or excess materials or energy from point and nonpoint sources,,"This class deals with exotic or excess materials introduced to the environment. There is obviously a fine distinction when the pollution comes from another threat - for example, should an oil spill from a pipeline be classified as 4.2 Utility & Service Lines or 9.2 Industrial & Military Effluents? You will have to exercise some judgement here as to which represents the direct threat in your situation. In some cases, the source of the pollution may be either unknown or from a historical source (e.g., heavy metals buried in sediments). In these cases, you may have to make an educated guess as to which category to assign the pollutant."
95,9.1,Domestic & urban waste water,no,"Water-borne sewage and non-point runoff from housing and urban areas that include nutrients, toxic chemicals and/or sediments",,"This category does not include major industrial discharge, which falls under 9.2 Industrial & Military Effluents. It does include chemicals and next generation pollutants (caffeine or pharmaceuticals) in household waste streams.
