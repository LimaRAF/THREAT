1,1,Land/water protection,no,"Actions to identify, establish or expand parks and other legally protected areas",,"This class contains all actions designed to directly protect biodiversity through parks, reserves, easements, or other similar means."
2,1.1,Site/area protection,depend (if threatened),"Establishing or expanding public or private parks, reserves, and other protected areas roughly equivalent to IUCN Categories I-VI (includes marine protected areas)","national parks, nature reserves, marine protected areas (MPAs), town wildlife sanctuaries, private reserves, tribally owned hunting grounds, communal protected areas, etc.","For many years, this was the primary action used by conservationists. The actual management of protected areas fall into 2.1 Site/Area Management."
3,1.2,Resource & habitat protection,depend (if CR or CR PE),Establishing protection or easements of some specific aspect of the resource on public or private lands outside of IUCN Categories I-VI,"easements, development rights, water rights, instream flow rights, wild & scenic river designation, etc.",This category is for efforts to legally protect some part of the overall resource rather than the entire entity.
4,2,Land/water management,no,"Actions directed at conserving or restoring sites, habitats and the wider environment",,This class contains all actions involved in directly managing habitats.
5,2.1,Site/area management,no,Management of protected areas and other resource lands for conservation,"maintenenance of habitat, site design, demarcating borders, erecting fences, training park staff, control of poachers, etc.",The establishment of protected areas goes into the appropriate category in 1. Land/Water Protection – this category covers the actual management of the land or water. Of particular concern are the many 'paper' parks or reserves which have been designated but lack proper implementation and management.
6,2.2,Invasive/problematic species control,no,"Controlling and/or preventing invasive and/or other problematic plants, animals, and pathogens","cutting vines off trees, preventing ballast water discharge, etc.","This could arguably fit into 2.1 Site/Area Management and others, but it is such a vital action it gets its own category."
7,2.3,Habitat & natural process restoration,depend (if CR or CR PE),Enhancing degraded or restoring missing habitats and ecosystem functions; dealing with pollution,"creating forest corridors, prairie re-creation, riparian tree plantings, coral reef restoration, mangrove replanting, prescribed burns, breaching levees, dam removal, installing fish ladders, liming acid lakes, cleaning up oil spills , modifying land use policy (to reduce or stop logging and sedimentation), etc.",This category involves the restoration of degraded lands and natural processes as opposed to the protection of existing ones.
8,3,Species management,no,"Actions directed at managing or restoring species, focused on the species of concern itself",,"This class contains all actions involved in directly managing species. The difference between land/water management and species management is defined as follows: If the action targets two or fewer specific species, it is Species Management; if it targets three or more, it’s Land/Water Management. For example fish ladders aimed at one salmon species fit in species recovery; fish ladders aimed at several different species fit in natural process restoration."
9,3.1,Species management,no,Managing specific plant and animal populations of concern,,Note that culling deer to save a rare plant that they are eating is 2.2 Invasive/Problematic Species Control whereas culling deer to manage the deer population itself fits here.
10,3.1.1,Harvest management,depend (if threatened wood),,"harvest management of wild mushrooms, setting fishing quotas, seting catch-size limits, etc.",Applies to any species that would benefit from harvest management or fishing effort controls.
11,3.1.2,Trade management,depend (if traded),,"setting harvest quotas, trade regulations for specific populations, non CITES trade regulations, aquarium trade regulation, regulation of trade in non-timber forest products, etc.",
12,3.1.3,Limiting population growth,no,,"culling buffalo to keep population size within park carrying capacity, sterilization of animals, etc.",
13,3.2,Species recovery,no,"Manipulating, enhancing or restoring specific plant and animal populations, vaccination programs","manual pollination of trees, artificial nesting boxes/platforms, clutch manipulation, supplementary feeding, disease/pathogen/parasite management, etc.",
14,3.3,Species re-introduction,no,Re-introducing species to places where they formally occurred or benign introductions,,
15,3.3.1,Reintroduction,depend (if overharvested),,,Re-introductions are to areas where the species formerly occurred preferably following the IUCN Re-introduction Guidelines.
16,3.3.2,Benign introduction,no,,,"Benign introductions are to areas outside of the species' historic range, but within an appropriate habitat and done deliberately for conservation reasons."
17,3.4,Ex-situ conservation,depend (if CR or CR PE),Protecting biodiversity out of its native habitats,,"This is one of the key strategies practiced by zoos, aquaria and botanical gardens interested in conservation."
18,3.4.1,Captive breeding/artificial propagation,no,,"captive breeding of animals, propagation of plants from seeds or cuttings, artificial propagation of plants, etc.",
19,3.4.2,Genome resource bank,no,,"gene-banking, cryopreservation, etc.",
20,4,Education & awareness,no,"Actions directed at people to improve understanding and skills, and influence behavior",,This class obviously overlaps a bit with 7. External Capacity Building; actions in this class tend to target individuals rather than organizations.
21,4.1,Formal education,no,Enhancing knowledge and skills of students in a formal degree programme,"public schools, colleges & universities, continuing education, etc.",
22,4.2,Training,depend (if CR or CR PE),"Enhancing knowledge, skills and information exchange for practitioners, stakeholders, and other relevant individuals in structured settings outside of degree programmes","monitoring workshops or training courses in reserve design for park managers, learning networks or writing how-to manuals for project managers, stakeholder education on specific issues, improving species identification skills (especially of animal or plant parts in trade), training on how to set shark nets for beach protection to minimize bycatch of sharks and cetaceans, etc.",This category refers to training outside of formal degree programmes.
23,4.3,Awareness & communications,depend (if CR or CR PE),Raising environmental awareness and providing information through various media or through civil disobedience,"radio soap operas, environmental publishing, web blogs, puppet shows, door-to-door canvassing, tree sitting, protest marches, etc.",This is a large category that involves many different efforts to raise awareness about conservation issues in specific stakeholder groups and the general public. There is a grey area between general awareness campaigns which belong in this category versus campaigns to enact specific legislation which belong in 5. Law & Policy. Many mainstream conservation organizations do not use the more disruptive and illegal forms of moral confrontation -- inclusion of them in an effort to make this taxonomy comprehensive should by no means constitute an endorsement of them.
24,5,Law & policy,no,"Actions to develop, change, influence, and help implement formal legislation, regulations, and voluntary standards",,"This class contains a series of strategies aimed at using government powers at all levels to protect biodiversity. There is a sequence embedded in this class that involves enacting or changing the legislation, policy, or standard and then promoting compliance or enforcement of it. Some organizations do both, others only one or the other."
25,5.1,Legislation,no,"Making, implementing, changing, influencing, or providing input into formal government sector legislation or polices at all levels: international, national, state/provincial, local, tribal",,"Public legislation refers to the official legal code governing society – what some people refer to as ""hard law."""
26,5.1.1,International level,depend (if threatened and not endemic),,"List the type of legislation and the specific action being taken e.g., promoting conventions on biodiversity, wildlife trade laws like CITES, regional legislation like the European Habitats Directive, etc.",
27,5.1.2,National level,depend (if threatened and endemic),,"List the type of legislation and the specific action being taken e.g., work for or against government laws such as the US Endangered Species Act, influencing legislative appropriations, etc.",
28,5.1.3,Sub-national level,no,,"List the type of legislation and the specific action being taken e.g., State/Pprovincial: state ballot initiatives, providing data to state policy makers, developing pollution permitting systems, dam relicensing Local: developing zoning regulations, countryside laws, species protection laws, hunting bans Tribal: creating tribal laws, etc.",
29,5.1.4,Scale unspecified,depend,,List the type of legislation and the specific action being taken,
30,5.2,Policies and regulations,depend (if overharvested),"Making, implementing, changing, influencing, or providing input into policies and regulations affecting the implementation of laws at all levels: international, national, state/provincial, local/community, tribal","Input into agency plans regulating certain species or resources, working with local governments or communities to implement zoning regulations; promoting sustainable harvest of timber on state forest lands, etc.","Policies and regulations are how legislation gets implemented – what some people refer to as ""soft law."" This is a relatively narrow definition of the word ""policy."""
31,5.3,Private sector standards & codes,no,"Setting, implementing, changing, influencing, or providing input into voluntary standards & professional codes that govern private sector practice","Marine & Forest Stewardship Councils, Marine Aquarium Council, Conservation Measures Partnership (CMP) Open Standards, corporate adoption of forestry best management practices, sustainable grazing by a rancher, etc.",These are codes of practice that are adopted by an organization or industry on a voluntary (as opposed to mandated) basis. Mandatory laws and regulations fall under 5.1 Legislation or 5.2 Policies & Regulations.
32,5.4,Compliance and enforcement,no,"Monitoring and enforcing compliance with laws, policies & regulations, and standards & codes at all levels",,"Laws, policies, regulations, and standards are useless if they are not implemented and enforced. Some organizations merely try to monitor compliance whereas others have the power of enforcement."
33,5.4.1,International level,depend (if CITES),,,"Select the relevant level(s) and list the action e.g., CITES enforcement, water quality standard monitoring, initiating criminal and civil litigation, etc."
34,5.4.2,National level,no,,,"Select the relevant level(s) and list the action e.g., CITES enforcement, water quality standard monitoring, initiating criminal and civil litigation, etc."
35,5.4.3,Sub-national level,no,,,"Select the relevant level(s) and list the action e.g., CITES enforcement, water quality standard monitoring, initiating criminal and civil litigation, etc."
36,5.4.4,Scale unspecified,no,,,"Select the relevant level(s) and list the action e.g., CITES enforcement, water quality standard monitoring, initiating criminal and civil litigation, etc."
37,6,"Livelihood, economic & other incentives",no,Actions to use economic and other incentives to influence behaviour,,This class of actions has been gaining in popularity in the past few years.
38,6.1,Linked enterprises & livelihood alternatives,no,Developing enterprises that directly depend on the maintenance of natural resources or provide substitute livelihoods as a means of changing behaviours and attitudes,"ecotourism, non-timber forest product harvesting, harvesting wild salmon to create value for wild population, etc.","In linked enterprises, the health of the enterprise directly depends on the health of the biodiversity - for example, a community homestay that depends on tourists coming to visit an intact coral reef. Livelihood alternatives are established to move people from destructive actions to non-destructive ones -- for example, a community homestay that keeps the operator from working as a logger."
39,6.2,Substitution,depend (if overharvested),Promoting alternative products and services that substitute for environmentally damaging ones,"Viagra for rhino horn, farmed salmon as a replacement for pressure on wild populations, promoting recycling and use of recycled materials, etc.",This category involves developing products and services explicitly to remove pressure from biodiversity.
40,6.3,Market forces,depend (if threatened wood),Using market mechanisms to change behaviours and attitudes,"certification, positive incentives, boycotts, negative incentives, grass & forest banking, valuation of ecosystem services such as flood control, etc.",This category includes both positive and negative incentives for conservation. This category deals with incentive-based standards; non-incentive standards go in 5.2 Policies & Regulations.
41,6.4,Conservation payments,no,Using direct or indirect payments to change behaviours and attitudes,"quid-pro-quo performance payments, resource tenure incentives, etc.",This category involves a direct payment for conservation behaviours.
42,6.5,Non-monetary values,no,Using intangible values to change behaviours and attitudes,"spiritual, cultural, links to human health, etc.","This category cuts across the others in this class, but involves those cases where the incentives are not financial."
43,7,External Capacity Building,no,Actions to build the infrastructure to do better conservation,,"Every organization has to develop its own capacity to design, implement, manage, and learn from its work. These basic functions are not considered part of this classification scheme. However, if a group does this type of work to help partner organizations, then it should be part of this class."
44,7.1,Institutional & Civil Society Development,depend (if CR or CR PE),"Creating or providing non-financial support & capacity building for non-profits, government agencies, communities, and for-profits","creating new local land trusts, providing circuit riders to help develop organizational capacity, etc.",Building conservation institutions.
45,7.2,Alliance & Partnership Development,depend (if CR or CR PE),"Forming and facilitating partnerships, alliances, and networks of organizations","country networks, Conservation Measures Partnership (CMP), Cambridge Conservation Initiative (CCI), etc.","Promoting cross-organizational informational sharing, learning, and collaboration."
