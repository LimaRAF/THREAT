Nearctic|Palearctic,"Conservation actions for Polar Bears vary by jurisdiction and detailed information can be found in Obbard <em>et al</em>. (2010) and at <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>. The International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears that was signed in 1973 by the five nations Canada, Denmark (Greenland) Norway, Soviet Union (Russian Federation) and USA, provides guidance. Article II of the Agreement states that each contracting party “…shall manage polar bear populations in accordance with sound conservation practices based on the best available scientific data,…” and according to Article VII, “The Contracting Parties shall conduct national research programs on Polar Bears…” and&#160; “...consult with each other on the management of migrating Polar Bear populations...”. These articles have been important for stimulating governments to support applied research to answer management questions regarding Polar Bears throughout their range.<br/><br/>In light of the growing concern over Polar Bear conservation in relation to climate change and a number of other issues, such as oil- and gas activities, shipping and tourism, the five Parties have agreed to initiate a process that would lead to a coordinated approach to conservation and management strategies for Polar Bears. A key aspect of this approach is the recognition that plans for action should be developed at a national level leading up to development of comprehensive circumpolar plan for action that address Polar Bear conservation. The Circumpolar Action Plan for Polar Bear is planned to be signed by the parties in autumn 2015.<br/><br/>The Parties recognize that Article VII of the Agreement calls for all Parties to conduct national research programs, particularly relating to the conservation and management of Polar Bears, and that they shall coordinate such research and exchange information on research programs, results, and data on bears taken. The Parties continue to be committed to carrying out research in support of Polar Bear conservation. The Parties also recognize that the technical support and scientific advice on Polar Bear conservation provided by the PBSG supports the 1973 Agreement and is a vital part of the decision making process that the competent authorities should consider in making management decisions. The PBSG has accepted to serve as an independent science advisory body to the Parties.<br/><br/>The PBSG regards the 1973 Agreement as the cornerstone and basis for any action plan on Polar Bears. The PBSG has identified the following research elements to be included in all action plans (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012):<br/><ul><li>Assessment of subpopulation size and/or trend and projection of future status</li><li>Monitoring harvest and other removals</li><li>Understanding movements and distribution patterns and how they are changing with ongoing habitat changes</li><li>Establishing trends in physical condition and why they are changing</li><li>Documenting human-bear conflicts</li><li>Documenting trends in habitat use, availability and trends</li><li>Documenting trends in pollution and disease</li><li>Vital rates estimation, evaluating trends and projection</li></ul>The PBSG recognizes that particular elements (for example, monitoring of pollution and sea ice habitat) are of inter-jurisdictional concern and would benefit from multi-jurisdictional cooperation. Further, the Parties shall consult with each other on the management of shared Polar Bear subpopulations, and exchange information on research and management programs. The PBSG has reiterated that all management actions be based on the best scientific information. The PBSG has identified these management elements to be included in all action plans (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012):<br/><ul><li>Protection of essential habitats</li><li>Use of scientific evidence</li><li>Monitoring, prevention and sound management of human-bear conflicts</li><li>Development of inter-jurisdictional agreements for shared populations</li><li>Development of management strategies to minimize impacts of human activities (e.g. mining, shipping, oil and gas activities, tourism and other human-caused disturbance)</li><li>Management of sustainable harvest</li><li>Ensure the active involvement of the local public living in polar bear areas in developing and achieving the goals of the action plan </li></ul><p></p>","Polar Bears occur at low densities throughout the circumpolar Arctic and are more abundant in shallower, ice-covered waters associated with the continental shelf where currents or upwellings increase biological productivity. Seasonally, in the summer open water season, Polar Bears may be found on land in higher densities.<br/><br/>The Polar Bear is a K-selected species with late sexual maturity, small litter size, high maternal investment and high adult survival. The Polar Bear’s reproductive rate is among the lowest in all mammals (Bunnell and Tait 1981) although similar to that of other ursids. Females generally mature at 4-5 years, and enter a prolonged oestrus between late March and early June, although most mating occurs in April and early May. Ovulation is induced by mating (Stirling 2009), and implantation is delayed until autumn. The total gestation period ranges between 195-265 days (Uspenski 1977, Amstrup 2003). Whether or not the embryo implants and proceeds to develop is likely determined by body condition. Pregnant females enter dens in snow drifts or slopes on land, close to the sea (Andersen <em>et al</em>. 2012), or on sea ice (in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas) as early as September/October, but more typically in late autumn (Lentfer and Hensel 1980, Amstrup and Gardner 1994, Wiig 1998). Females give birth inside the den, usually in late December to early January (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 1992, Amstrup 2003). Polar Bears most often give birth to twin cubs; singleton and triplet litters are less frequent. Newborn Polar Bears are blind, sparsely haired and weigh approximately 0.6 kg (Blix and Lentfer 1979). They grow rapidly, fed on rich milk from their mother (36% fat; Derocher <em>et al</em>. 1993), and when they emerge from the den sometime between early March and late April (Pedersen 1945, Wiig 1998), they weigh 10-12 kg (Amstrup 2003). In some regions, after emerging from the den, the female may not have fed for a period up to 8 months, which may be the longest period of food deprivation for any mammal (Watts and Hansen 1987).<br/><br/>Cub mortality is high in the first year (Larsen 1985, Amstrup and Durner 1995, Wiig 1998), with the probability of cub survival largely determined by maternal condition. Mothers with larger fat stores in the fall emerge in the spring with larger cubs which are more likely to survive (Atkinson and Ramsay 1995, Derocher and Stirling 1998, Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2012a). The young usually stay with their mother for two years (Lønø 1970, Stirling et al. 1976, Amstrup and Durner 1995, Wiig 1998), and consequently females on average do not enter a new reproductive cycle more often than every third year most places (Amstrup 2003). In contrast to their low reproductive rates, adult Polar Bears have high survival rates (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Polar Bears are the most carnivorous of the extant species of bears. Throughout their range, Ringed Seals (<em>Phoca hispida</em>), preferably young-of-the-year, and to a lesser extent Bearded Seals (<em>Erignathus barbatus</em>) are their primary prey (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2002, Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2008). In some areas they are also known to take Harp Seals (<em>Pagophilus groenlandicus</em>), Hooded Seals (<em>Cystophora cristata</em>), and even larger species such as Walrus (<em>Odobenus rosmarus</em>) and Beluga (<em>Delphinapterus leucas</em>) (Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2008). Polar Bears digest fat more efficiently than protein (Best 1984). Polar Bears are large when compared to other ursid species, which is a consequence of their energy-rich diet. Although birds, fish, vegetation and kelp are eaten where locally available during the ice free-season (Pedersen 1945, Russell 1975, Dyck and Romberg 2007, Born <em>et al</em>. 2011, Gormezano and Rockwell 2013), it is unlikely that Polar Bears would be capable of gaining enough nutritional benefit to survive on a primarily terrestrial diet (Ramsay and Hobson 1991, Hobson <em>et al</em>. 2009, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2010b, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2015).",Done,"At present, 19 subpopulation units of Polar Bears are recognized by the Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG) of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Genetic studies have shown that gene flow occurs among the various subpopulations (Paetkau <em>et al</em>. 1999, Crompton <em>et al</em>. 2008, Peacock <em>et al</em>. 2015) and there is no evidence that any of the units have been evolutionarily separated for significant periods of time. Although demographic exchange may be limited between subpopulations (Mauritzen <em>et al</em>. 2002, Crompton <em>et al</em>. 2008, Peacock <em>et al</em>. 2015), some demographic and genetic exchange occurs. Consequently, the Polar Bear subpopulations cannot be considered as distinct demographic units and the term “management units” may be more accurate. Ongoing reductions in the duration, distribution, and quality of sea ice due to climate change (Sahanatien and Derocher 2012) may result in different levels of genetic and demographic exchange among subpopulations in the future (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004, Molnár <em>et al</em>. 2010), which could lead to&#160; new metapopulation dynamics or to functionally isolated subpopulations.<br/><br/>The PBSG summarized the best-available scientific information on the status of the 19 subpopulations of Polar Bears in 2014 (PBSG 2015) including an assessment of current trend (i.e., estimated change in population size over a 12-year period, centred on the time of assessment). The PBSG concluded that one subpopulation (M’Clintock Channel) has increased, six were stable (Davis Strait, Foxe Basin, Gulf of Boothia, Northern Beaufort Sea, Southern Hudson Bay, and Western Hudson Bay), three were considered to have declined (Baffin Bay, Kane Basin, and Southern Beaufort Sea) and, for the remaining nine (Arctic Basin, Barents Sea, Chukchi Sea, East Greenland, Kara Sea, Lancaster Sound, Laptev Sea, Norwegian Bay, and Viscount Melville Sound) there were insufficient data to provide an assessment of current trend. The type, precision, and time span of data used to estimate trends varies among subpopulations (PBSG 2015).<br/><br/>Estimating Polar Bear abundance is expensive and difficult because the animals often occur at low densities in remote habitats. Although abundance estimates have generally improved in recent decades (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010), information remains poor or outdated for some subpopulations. Summing across the most recent estimates for the 19 subpopulations (Table 3 in the Supplementary Material) results in a total of approximately 26,000 Polar Bears ( 95% CI = 22,000-31,000 ). We note that this number differs from what would be obtained by summing abundance estimates in PBSG (2015), because criteria were not the same for including abundance estimates in the two sources (section Population projections). The total number presented here does not include the Arctic Basin subpopulation, for which no information on abundance is available. The 95% confidence intervals presented here were generated using simulation based on estimates of uncertainty in Table 3 and an assumption that the abundance of every subpopulation is independent of the others (see the section <em>Population projections</em> in the Supplementary Material). The mixed quality and even lack of available information on each subpopulation means caution is warranted when establishing and reporting a single estimate of the number of polar bears across the circumpolar Arctic. Therefore we used the abundance data in Table 3 in a relative manner, to scale subpopulation-specific changes to changes in the global population size, rather than in an absolute manner.<br/><p></p>",Unknown,"<p>Polar Bears live throughout the ice-covered waters of the circumpolar Arctic (Obbard <em>et al.</em> 2010, <a href=""http://www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>). Although some occur in the permanent multi-year pack ice of the central Arctic basin, they are most common in the annual ice over the continental shelf and inter-island archipelagos that surround the polar basin. Polar Bears that have continuous access to sea ice are able to hunt throughout the year. However, in those areas where the sea ice melts completely each summer,&#160;Polar Bears&#160;are forced to spend several months on land, where they primarily fast on stored fat reserves until freeze-up. Use of land by&#160;Polar Bears&#160;during the ice-free season appears to be increasing at least in some areas where sea ice duration has declined (e.g., Schliebe <em>et al.</em> 2008, Herreman and Peacock 2013).&#160;The southern extent of the range of&#160;Polar Bears&#160;occurs off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. The northernmost documented observation of a&#160;Polar Bear&#160;was at 89°46’N, 25 km from the North Pole (van Meurs and Splettstoesser 2003).&#160;Currently, the most southerly known denning area is on Akimiski Island in James Bay, Canada, at about 52°35’N (Kolenosky and Prevett 1983).</p><p>The species is found in Canada (Manitoba, Newfoundland, Labrador, Nunavut, Northwest Territories, Quebec, Yukon Territory, Ontario), Greenland/Denmark, Norway (including Svalbard), Russian Federation (North European Russia, Siberia, Chukotka, Sakha (Yakutia), Krasnoyarsk), United States (Alaska). Also, vagrants occasionally reach Iceland.</p>",27/08/2015,3.1,,true,VU,A3c,,false,false,,"Loss of Arctic sea ice due to climate change is the most serious threat to Polar Bears throughout their circumpolar range (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, Stirling and Derocher 2012, USFWS 2015). We performed a data-based sensitivity analysis with respect to this threat by evaluating the potential response of the global Polar Bear population to projected sea-ice conditions. Our analyses included a comprehensive assessment of generation length (GL) for Polar Bears; development of a standardized sea-ice metric representing important habitat characteristics for the species; and population projections, over three Polar Bear generations, using computer simulation and statistical models representing alternative relationships between sea ice and Polar Bear abundance.<br/><br/>Our analyses highlight the potential for large reductions in the global Polar Bear population if sea-ice loss continues, which is forecast by climate models and other studies (IPCC 2013). Our analyses also highlight the large amount of uncertainty in statistical projections of Polar Bear abundance and the sensitivity of projections to plausible alternative assumptions. Across six scenarios that projected polar bear abundance three generations forward in time using the median and 95th percentile of estimated GL, the median probability of a reduction in the mean global population size greater than 30% was approximately 0.71 (range 0.20-0.95; see Table 4 in the attached Supporting Material). The median probability of a reduction greater than 50% was approximately 0.07 (range 0-0.35), and the probability of a reduction greater than 80% was negligible. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List Guidelines suggests that assessors consider nearly the full range of uncertainty in potential outcomes, and adopt a precautionary but realistic attitude toward risk tolerance (Section 3.2.3, IUCN 2014). In light of the significant probability, across scenarios, of a reduction in mean global population size greater than 30%, and the relatively low probability of a reduction greater than 50%, we conclude that Polar Bears currently warrant listing as Vulnerable under criterion A3c (IUCN 2014).",Same category and criteria,,,,No change,Terrestrial|Marine,"Anthropogenic and natural changes in Arctic environments, as well as recognition of the shortcomings of our knowledge of Polar Bear ecology, are increasing the challenges for Polar Bear conservation and management. Higher ambient temperatures and erratic weather fluctuations, symptoms of anthropogenic climate change, are increasing across the range of polar bears. Polar Bears are dependent upon Arctic sea ice for access to their prey. Their dependence on an ephemeral habitat that exists as a function of sea surface and atmospheric temperatures means that climate warming poses the single most important threat to the long-term persistence of Polar Bears (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Arctic sea ice loss has thus far progressed faster than most climate models have predicted (Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2007) with September sea extent declining at a linear rate of 14% per decade from 1979 through 2011 (Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2012, Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2014). Because changes in sea-ice are known to alter Polar Bear abundance, productivity, body condition, and distribution (Stirling <em>et al</em>. 1999, Fischbach <em>et al</em>. 2007, Schleibe <em>et al</em>. 2008, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2009, Regehr <em>et al</em>. 2010, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2010a, 2012, 2014b, Bromaghin <em>et al</em>. 2015), continued climate warming will increase future uncertainty and pose severe risks to the welfare of Polar Bear subpopulations (Stirling and Derocher 2012, Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2013). Arctic sea ice extent is linearly related to global mean temperature, which in turn, is directly related to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2010). Population and habitat models predict substantial declines in the distribution and abundance of Polar Bears in the future (Durner <em>et al</em>. 2009, Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2010, Castro de la Guardia <em>et al</em>. 2013, Hamilton et al. 2014). Although Polar Bears living in historically colder regions of the Arctic might derive transient benefit from a climate-driven transition away from multi-year ice (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004), the annual sea ice must persist long enough for Polar Bears to derive benefit from associated changes in seal availability and biological productivity. Recent sea ice simulations suggest large regions of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago will be ice free for &gt;5 months by the late 21<sup>st</sup> century (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2014). In other parts of the Arctic, the 5-month ice-free threshold may be reached by the middle of the 21<sup>st</sup> century (Atwood <em>et al</em>. 2015). These studies are based on sea-ice data obtained from the World Climate Research Programme's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) (<a href=""http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/"">http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/</a>). An annual ice-free period of ≥5 months is likely to lead to extended fasting, which is predicted to lead to increased reproductive failure and starvation (Molnár <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2014a, Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2012b). Nevertheless, uncertainty and regional variability in the near-term effects of climate change must be included in Polar Bear management and conservation plans.<br/><br/>Although there have been local and regional studies on polar bear denning habitat (Kolenosky and Prevett 1983, Messier <em>et al</em>. 1994, Lunn <em>et al</em>. 2004, Richardson <em>et al</em>. 2005, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2006, 2013, Andersen <em>et al</em>. 2012), large scale mapping of Polar Bear denning habitat across the Arctic has not occurred. It is also unknown how climate change will change denning locations and habitats, though predicted increases in forest fires may have adverse effects on maternity denning habitat in sub-Arctic regions (Richardson <em>et al</em>. 2007). Declining sea ice availability can impair the ability of pregnant females to reach traditional denning areas (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2011, Cherry <em>et al</em>. 2013) and increases of rain events will be detrimental for denning Polar Bears (Stirling and Derocher 1993, Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>The occurrence of diseases and parasites in Polar Bears is rare compared with occurrences in other ursids. However, with warming Arctic temperatures, altered climate could influence&#160; infectious disease epidemiology through mechanisms such as novel pathogen introduction due to range expansion of carrier animals and arthropod vectors; modification of host susceptibility; changes in pathogen evolution, transmission, and number of generations per year; host immunosuppression; shifts in main food sources; altered behaviour; and co-infections with multiple agents (Harvell <em>et al</em>. 2002, Parmesan 2006, Burek <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hueffer <em>et al</em>. 2011). As a result, the potential for exposure to pathogens and resulting disease outbreaks may become more significant threats as Polar Bears experience the cumulative effects of multiple stressors (Patyk <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>The warming climate has been associated with an increase in pathogens in other Arctic marine and terrestrial organisms. Parasitic agents that have developmental stages outside the bodies of warm-blooded hosts (e.g., nematodes: Laaksonen <em>et al</em>. 2010) will likely benefit from the warmer and wetter weather projected for the Arctic. Improved conditions for such parasites have already adversely affected the health of some Arctic mammals (Kutz <em>et al</em>. 2013). Bacterial parasites also are likely to benefit from a warmer and wetter Arctic (e.g., <em>Vibrio parahaemolyticu</em>s; Baker-Austin <em>et al</em>. 2012). As the effects of climate change become more prevalent, there is concern about the emergence of new pathogens within polar bear range, new threats from existing pathogens that may be able to infect immuno-compromised/stressed bears, and the potential for new and existing pathogens to cross human–animal boundaries (e.g., giardia). Because of the previous limited exposure of Polar Bears to diseases and parasites (Fagre <em>et al</em>. 2015), researchers have as yet been unable to determine whether they will be more susceptible to new pathogens. However, concern is exacerbated by the fact that Polar Bears appear to have a naïve immune system (Weber <em>et al</em>. 2013), which may make them particularly vulnerable to infection. Many different pathogens have been found in seal species that are Polar Bear prey; the potential therefore exists for transmission of these diseases to Polar Bears (Kirk <em>et al</em>. 2010). If Polar Bears become nutritionally stressed, altered foraging behaviours such as increased feeding on the internal organs of their primary prey and use of alternative foods (e.g., Prop et al. 2015) may increase the potential for exposure to pathogens. Ensuring the long-term persistence of Polar Bears will necessitate understanding how a rapidly changing physical environment modulates exposure to disease risk factors and, ultimately, population health.<br/><br/>Persistent organic pollutants, which reach Arctic regions via long range transport by air and ocean currents as well as river run off, also increase uncertainty for the welfare of polar bears (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>). Although Polar Bears live in relatively pristine Arctic regions, a variety of industrial toxic substances are brought into Polar Bear management areas from human anthropogenic activities around the world. Polar Bears are apex predators and are therefore exposed to high levels of pollutants, which magnify with each step in the food web resulting in high concentrations in polar bear tissue (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010). A key characteristic of these pollutants is that they persist in the environment due to low biotic and abiotic degradation. The contaminant burdens among Polar Bears are known to vary among regions (e.g., Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2011). Even where contaminant burdens may be known, their effects on Polar Bear physiol­ogy and health are not well understood (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sonne <em>et al</em>. 2012). However, Dietz <em>et al</em>. (2015) showed that the risk for reproductive, immune suppressive and carcinogenic effects in polar bear subpopulations across the Arctic are high due to PCB and perflourinated compounds (PFCs) exposure.<br/><br/>Many of the contaminants are lipophilic and bond tightly to lipophilic tissues. Polar Bears are particularly vulnerable to organochlorines because they eat a fat rich diet. Ringed, bearded, and harp seals comprise the main food of Polar Bears and the blubber layer is preferentially eaten by the bears and subsequently, the intake of pollutants is high (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010). Recent studies have documented new pollutants in polar bear tissues which expose the species to even more toxic and complex combination of industrial chemicals (Verreault <em>et al</em>. 2005, 2006; Muir <em>et al</em>. 2006; Smithwick <em>et al</em>. 2006; McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2011; Gebbink <em>et al</em>. submitted). The potential for contam­inants to impact Arctic systems is predicted to increase as climate warming alters global circulation and precipitation patterns (Macdonald <em>et al</em>. 2005, Jenssen <em>et al</em>. 2015) and predicting local and regional effects will become more complicated and uncertain.<br/><br/>A three decade study (1983-2010) of East Greenland Polar Bears revealed both declines of conventional POPs and increases in brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and PFCs (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2013a,b; Riget <em>et al</em>. 2013). The last decade has showed climate related increases in PCBs as well as peaks of BFRs and PFCs due to recent industrial reductions (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2013b McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Although the effects of pollutants on polar bears are only partially understood, levels of such pollutants in some subpopulations are already sufficiently high that they may interfere with hormone regulation, immune system function, and possibly reproduction (Wiig <em>et al</em>. 1998; Bernhoft <em>et al</em>. 2000; Skaare <em>et al</em>. 2000, 2001; Gustavson <em>et al</em>. 2015; Henriksen <em>et al</em>. 2001; Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2003; Derocher 2005; Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2015; Sonne <em>et al</em>. 2015). There are suggestions that species with delayed implantation are more vulnerable to the effects of pollution through endocrine (hormone) disruption (Knott <em>et al</em>. 2011). Further, because female Polar Bears are food deprived during gestation, their pollution load increases in their blood, when energy and pollutants are mobilized from their adipose tissue. Because the cubs are nursed on fat rich milk they are exposed to very high pollution loads from their mother (Polishuk <em>et al</em>. 2002, Bytingsvik <em>et al</em>. 2012). This may pose the greatest threat to the species as the vulnerability of pre- and neonatal polar bears is the most sensible to life-long health effects from long-range transported pollution which decreases immunity, survival and reproductive success (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sonne 2010).<br/><br/>An additional emerging threat to Polar Bears is the increase in resource exploration and development in the Arctic along with increased ice-breaking and shipping. There are currently no data on the effects of ice-breaking on habitat use by Polar Bears. Although some studies suggest that Polar Bears are sensitive to localized disturbance at maternity den sites (Lunn <em>et al</em>. 2004, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2006), our knowledge about potential effects of large scale development is lacking.<br/><br/>Oil development in the Arctic poses a wide of range of threats to Polar Bears ranging from oil spills to increased human-bear interactions. It is probable that an oil spill in sea ice habitat would result in oil being concentrated in leads and between ice floes resulting in both Plar Bears and their main prey (Ringed Seal and Bearded Seal) being directly exposed to oil. Polar Bears are often attracted by the smells and sound associated with human activity. Polar Bears are known to ingest plastic, styrofoam, lead acid batteries, tin cans, oil, and other hazardous materials with lethal consequences in some cases (Lunn and Stirling 1985, Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 1989, Derocher and Stirling 1991). Another concern is that seals covered in oil may be a major source of oil to polar bears. Although the biological threats and impacts of oil and gas activities on Polar Bears are reasonably well understood (Øritsland <em>et al</em>. 1981; Hurst and Øritsland 1982; Stirling 1988, 1990; Isaksen <em>et al</em>. 1998; Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2006), mitigation and response plans are currently lacking (but see Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2014). Moreover, how Polar Bears will be affected by other types of human activity are less well known (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Significant portions of the Polar Bear’s range already are being developed and exploration is proposed for many other areas. With warming induced sea ice decline, previously inaccess­ible areas will be exposed to development and other forms of anthropogenic activities (e.g., trans-Arctic shipping, tourism). The direct effects of human activities, the in­creased potential for negative human-bear encounters, and the potential for increased local pollution are all concerns that must be understood if we are to understand and manage impacts on the future for Polar Bears.<br/><br/>Our understanding of Polar Bear population dynamics has improved with ongoing development and refinement of analytical methods (e.g., Taylor <em>et al</em>. 1987, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2008a,b, 2009; Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2001; McDonald and Amstrup 2001; Regehr <em>et al</em>. 2007, 2010, 2015; Aars <em>et al</em>. 2009; Stapleton <em>et al</em>. 2014). These improved and new tools suggest that previous estimates of population parameters and numbers can be biased. Vital rates are subpopulation specific, and different from the generalized rates that were often used to generate previous status reports (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 1987). For the two subpopulations (Southern Beaufort Sea, Western Hudson Bay) that are known to have been impacted by climate change and where a long time series of abundance exist, harvest represents an additive impact. Illegal take of polar bears in Russia, combined with legal subsistence harvest in the U.S., may exceed sustainable limits for the Chukchi subpopulation (<a href=""http://pbsg.npolar.no/en/"">pbsg.npolar.no</a>). In many cases harvest documentation and the popula­tion data necessary to assess the impact of harvest both are insufficient to allow managers to provide the desired balance between potential yield and take. Given the cultural and eco­nomic importance of Polar Bear hunting in many regions, understanding the potential for and the impact of hunting continues to be a critical part of management (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012, <a href=""http://pbsg.npolar.no/en/"">pbsg.npolar.no</a>).<br/><br/>It is important that subpopulation estimates and projections are based on substantiated scientific data. In some areas, studies to estimate abundance occur infrequently so if the harvest rate is either initially set above the sustainable level or it becomes so, the subpopulation may be reduced before the next inventory is made. In addition, harvest practices may have to be reconsidered given recent knowledge about long-term environmental trends and fluctuations that can affect sustainable removal rates. In some jurisdictions in Canada, the governance system includes aboriginal co-management boards and aboriginal hunting organizations. In some of these co-management systems, both local knowledge and science are to be considered equally in both management and research decisions. Although scientific studies have concluded that the long-term effects of capturing and collaring polar bears are minimal (Ramsay and Stirling 1986, Messier 2000, Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2013, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2014a), some local groups nevertheless consider these techniques disrespectful or harmful to the animals. As a result, population inventory and ecological studies have been delayed or not permitted. On the other hand, alternative research techniques such as aerial surveys and genetic biopsy capture-recapture methods were designed and implemented. Reduced monitoring will constrain governments’ ability to assess sustainability of harvest especially if abundance is estimated from aerial surveys which cannot provide data on vital rates (Aars <em>et al</em>. 2009, Stapleton <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Human caused habitat change and increasing human-bear interactions also must be incorporated into polar bear population projections (e.g., Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2010) and polar bear harvest management in the future. Due to increased access to pre­viously isolated areas, Polar Bears will face increased risks from a variety of human–bear interactions. New settlements are possible with industrial development, and expansion of tourist visitations is assured. Although the fact of human–bear interactions can be reasonably measured, we have a long way to go to understand the effect of such interactions. The added stresses, resulting from a “more crowded” Arctic, may play an important role in the future welfare of Polar Bears.","The US, Canada, and Greenland allow and manage a subsistence harvest of Polar Bears; harvest is prohibited in Norway and Russia. The principal use of Polar Bears is for subsistence purposes (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>), including consumption of meat; use of hides for clothing; and small scale handicrafts. Whole hides may be used for subsistence needs, kept as trophies, or sold on open markets. The financial return from the sale of legally taken Polar Bear hides can provide important income for local people in Canada and Greenland. Sport hunting of Polar Bears only occurs in Canada and must be guided by local Inuit hunters. While communities can decide whether or not to allow sport hunts, these hunts must be accounted for within the annual quota assigned to a community; sport hunts are not additive to the quota. Sport hunting can be a major source of income for remote settlements because the financial return from the hunt greatly exceeds that of the hide value (Foote and Wenzel 2009). This often provides an important infusion into local, cash limited, economies.<br/><br/>Annual legal harvest of Polar Bears is between 700 and 800 or 3-4% of the estimated size of the total population of about 20-25,000 animals. The harvest level has been thought to be sustainable in most subpopulations (PBSG 2010). Although poaching, or illegal hunting of Polar Bears, is not thought to be of major concern, recent reports suggest that illegal hunting in eastern Russia may be as high as 100-200 bears per year (Kochnev 2004). At present, the PBSG is assessing the status of this problem in all jurisdictions. Mortality of bears in defence of life and property occur throughout the Polar Bears’ range and are probably inevitable in areas where Polar Bears and people co-exist.<br/><br/>Polar Bear based tourism, including public viewing and photography is increasing. Well established in Churchill, Canada, it is increasing in other remote areas, including Svalbard, Norway, and to a some extent in locations on the north coast of Alaska (primarily Kaktovik and to a lesser degree Barrow).<br/><br/>Polar Bear products are in trade. The range of different products and units of measure used in records makes it difficult to relate trade data to number of polar bears in trade. Export of Polar Bear products from Canada, where most polar bear products in trade originate, represented between 207 (2014) and 404 (2013) individuals in the period 2010-2014 (Canadian CITES authorities pers. comm.). Greenland introduced a voluntary temporary ban on export of Polar Bear products in 2007. All international trade in polar bear parts is surveyed and regulated by CITES. The polar bear is listed by CITES on Appendix II.",English,22823
Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Oceanian|Palearctic,"Dugongs are covered under three international conservation conventions: The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (also known as CMS or the Bonn Convention). Dugongs are also included in the Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI), goal five (Threatened Species). Additionally, the Convention on Wetlands (the Ramsar Convention) protects some important Dugong habitats.<br/><br/>To date, there has been little effective management intervention to reduce anthropogenic impacts on the Dugong, apart from legislative protection which is almost ubiquitous throughout its range. Protected area initiatives aim to protect Dugongs in many range states (Marsh <em>et al. </em>2011) and are most developed in Australia. Most of the marine protected areas outside Australia with the potential to protect Dugongs are ‘paper parks’ where laws and regulations exist but are not implemented. Strategic Action Programmes/Strategic Plans/Action Plans to protect Dugongs have been developed by countries in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden region (Gerges 2002), Indonesia (de Iongh <em>et al.</em> 2009a, 2009b) and South Pacific Regional Environmental Programme (SPREP; Gillespies 2005). However, effective enforcement of conservation regulations is a problem throughout most of the region because of poverty, lack of resources and personnel. The most pressing need is for alternative sustainable livelihoods that address poverty and provide incentives for conservation. The most promising initiative is the UNEP Dugong, Seagrass &amp; Coastal Communities Initiative (see <a href=""http://www.cms.int/en/publication/dugong-seagrass-and-coastal-communities-initiative"">http://www.cms.int/en/publication/dugong-seagrass-and-coastal-communities-initiative</a>).","Habitat requirements for Dugongs include coastal areas, shallow to medium deep, warm waters (15-17°C minimum with behavioural thermoregulation), seagrass beds supporting sub-tropical and tropical species of seagrass, particularly low fiber species (Hines <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012, Marsh <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Dugongs show great variability in movement patterns and migration, depending on the study area and the influence of seasonal temperature or rainfall on regional ecosystems. Long-distance movements by Dugongs along the Queensland coast are well-documented (Sheppard <em>et al.</em> 2006), even though Dugongs do not appear to undertake regular migrations and individual movements are individualistic (Sheppard <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Marsh <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Gredzens <em>et al. </em>2014). Cope <em>et al. </em>(2015) used pedigree analysis based on individual genetic markers to infer the movements of Dugongs between locations in southeast Queensland including Moreton Bay and Hervey Bay. They found that approximately 30% of assigned parents had at least one offspring found in a different locality, implying recent movement of the parent or offspring. This analysis suggested markedly more movement between localities than detected through repeated direct sampling of individuals (Seddon <em>et al.</em> 2014) or through telemetry (Sheppard <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006).",Done,"Five countries/territories (Australia, Bahrain, Papua New Guinea, Qatar and the United Arabian Emirates) support substantial subpopulations of Dugongs (thousands) with tens of thousands of Dugongs in northern Australia/Papua New Guinea alone (Marsh <em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, unpublished). The percentage of mature individuals is likely to vary between various subpopulations, but is likely to be somewhere between 45% and 70% (Marsh <em>et al.</em> 2011). Genetic information on Dugong stocks is mostly limited to the Australian region. Recent work based on mitochondrial DNA (Blair <em>et al.</em> 2014) shows that the Australian Dugong population is not panmictic. The Australian population still has high genetic diversity, indicating that recent population declines are not yet reflected in the genetic makeup of the population. Seddon <em>et al. </em>(2014) used microsatellite markers to demonstrate low, but significant, population differentiation within a regional in southern Queensland. Further data (D. Blair unpublished data) using the same genetic markers indicate considerable differentiation between southern and northern Queensland populations. Preliminary population-genetic and phylogeographic studies on Dugongs outside Australia are ongoing. These studies suggest strong regional differentiation. Australian populations are largely distinct from those elsewhere; populations in the Western Indian Ocean (Red Sea, Persian/Arabian Gulf, East Africa) are rather uniform and with limited genetic diversity; Madagascar might harbour a distinct lineage. The situation for the Indo-Malay Region is unclear but possibly more than one historical lineage occurs there. Thailand (Palmer 2004, L. Parr unpublished data) and Australia (McDonald 2005, Blair <em>et al.</em>&#160;2014) are home to distinct matrilines that possibly diverged during Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations, but are now able to mix geographically within those regions",Decreasing,"Dugongs inhabit coastal and island waters between East Africa and Vanuatu between latitudes of about 27° north and south of Equator. Spanning approximately 128,000 km of coastline (860,000 km<sup>2</sup>) across at least 37 and and possibly occur in an additional seven states and territories (Marsh <em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, N. Pilcher pers. comm).<p><span lang=""EN-US""></p>",12/07/2015,3.1,,false,VU,,"A2bcd+4bcd",false,false,,"Marsh <em>et al.</em> (2011) made a crude estimate of the Dugong’s extent of occurrence (EOO) as 860,000 km<sup>2</sup> based on potential habitat (waters &lt;10 m deep in its known range). This spans approximately 128,000 km of coastline across at least 37, and up to 44, countries and territories. Although the Dugong still occurs at the extremes of its range, Husar (1978) and IUCN (2009) list the Dugong as extinct in the waters of several islands including: the Maldives, the Lakshadweep Islands, Mascarene Islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues, and Taiwan (Husar 1978). Although this species may only have been vagrant at some of these islands (e.g. Taiwan, Hirasaka 1932), there is historical evidence of substantial Dugong populations off Mauritius and Rodrigues Islands; these populations were harvested in the 18th century (Cheke 1987). Cheke quotes historical accounts of a dugong fishery on Rodrigues in the 1730s. There is also anecdotal evidence that the area of occupancy (AOO) of the Dugong has declined in many parts of its range, especially along the coasts of east Africa and India. <br/><br/>The only reference site is the urban coast of Queensland between Cooktown and Brisbane, Australia where a 40 year time series of catch rates in nets set for bather protection indicates that the Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) in 1999 was only 3% of that in 1962 (Marsh <em>et al. </em>2005). This CPUE is considered an index of Dugong decline in the region from all causes during this period. This decline and modern aerial survey estimates of Dugong abundance were used to backcast the population in the region in the early 1960s (which would be expected to have been lower than that at the time of European settlement as a cottage commercial industry for Dugong oil had existed at several locations along this coast since the 1850s). The extrapolation suggested that the region supported 72,000 (95% CI 31,000, 165,000) Dugongs in the early 1960s compared with an estimated 4,220 (95% CI 2,360, 8,360) Dugongs in the mid 1990s. The seagrass habitat in the region is currently insufficient to support 72,000 Dugongs, a result which suggests that the habitat had also declined or that the shark net CPUE has overestimated the decline (see Marsh <em>et al.</em> 2005). If the magnitude of this decline was robust and typical of the entire range of the Dugong, the Dugong would qualify for being classified as Critically Endangered at a global scale. However, there are sites in Australia that support large populations of Dugongs (e.g. Shark Bay, Torres Strait) where it is unlikely that such a decline has occurred (Marsh <em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, unpublished). <br/><br/>The major causes of the Dugong’s decline along the urban coast of Queensland are still present in most of the Dugong’s range as follows: gill netting, subsistence hunting, habitat loss from extreme weather events that are likely to be exacerbated by climate change, human settlement and agricultural pollution. The magnitude of these threats is likely to be greater in most other parts of the Dugong’s range than in Queensland. The Queensland coast supports a low human population density relative to most other parts of the Dugong’s range and has a well- developed system of marine parks and pro-active management. Nonetheless there is evidence of ongoing decline in Dugong numbers (Sobtzick <em>et al</em>. 2012) along the urban coast of the Great Barrier Reef Region largely attributed to habitat loss associated with extreme weather events. <br/><br/>Marsh <em>et al. </em>(2011) undertook a regional assessment of the Dugong and concluded that the East African population was likely ‘Endangered’; Red Sea and Gulf of Aden ‘Data Deficient’; Arabians Gulf ‘Data Deficient’; Indian sub-continent and Andaman and Nicobar Islands ‘Endangered’; continental South East Asia ‘Endangered’; archipelagic East and South East Asia ‘Data Deficient’; Western Pacific Islands ‘Data Deficient’; and Palau and the Japan (Ryukyus) as Critically Endangered. The most recent assessment of the Australian population (Woinarski <em>et al.&#160;</em>2014) concluded it was ‘Near Threatened’. The Dugong’s confirmed range states include a mix of developing and developed countries and territories including countries and territories with a very high Human Development Index (HDI), countries with a high HDI, countries with a medium HDI and three countries with a low HDI (Marsh <em>et al.</em> 2011). The outlook for Dugongs in countries with a very small Dugong population and/or a low HDI must be poor. These countries include Brunei, Cambodia, China, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iran, Japan, Kenya, Madagascar, Mayotte, Mozambique, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Tanzania, Viet Nam and Yemen. Nonetheless, four countries/territories with a very high HDI (Australia, New Caledonia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates) support substantial populations of Dugongs (hundreds or thousands; Marsh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011), although even among and within these countries/territories the prospects are uneven. Because of the uncertainty associated with the assessment of the status of the Dugong, we suggest that the classification should remain as Vulnerable.",Same category and criteria,,,,No change,Marine,"Threats to Dugongs vary between different populations as detailed in Marsh <em>et al.</em> (2011) and Hines <em>et al.</em> (2012).&#160;Major threats include:<ul><li>Incidental capture in fishing gear (e.g. gill nets), shark nets for bather protection, IUU fishing especially if meat is subsequently sold (see Pilcher <em>et al. </em>2014, for a detailed rapid assessment based on questionnaires to provide information on conservation hotpots for Dugongs in 18 countries in four geographic areas: Pacific, Southeast Asia, South Asia and East Africa, with 6,153 respondents)</li><li>Hunting: legal (i.e. culturally sanctioned) and illegal</li><li>Boat strikes and boating activities (e.g. acoustic pollution)</li><li>Damage/modification/loss of habitat caused by human settlement on coasts, shipping, trawling destructive fishing, natural processes (e.g. cyclones and tsunamis)</li><li>Threats to seagrass (including untreated sewage disposal, coastal dredging and reclamation, inshore commercial trawling, agricultural pollution)</li><li>Chemical pollution (e.g. oil spills and heavy metal loads)</li><li>Climate change (extreme weather events and high temperatures)</li></ul>The major drivers for incidental capture in fishing gear and illegal hunting are poverty and declining fish stocks. Dugongs are legally protected in most of their range. However, enforcement is typically weak or non-existent. The imperative of artisanal fishers to break the law is increased by the opportunity to sell both Dugong meat (Robards and Reeves 2011) and valuable commodities such as swim bladders and shark fins (Marsh <em>et al. </em>2011). Artisanal coastal and riverine fisheries are vital to the livelihoods and food security of coastal peoples, especially in the tropics (Batista <em>et al. </em>2014), including most Dugong range states. On a global scale, such fisheries catch the same amount of fish for human consumption as commercial fisheries, yet employ some 25 times the number of fishers (over 12 million people; Chuenpagdee <em>et al.</em> 2008, Batista <em>et al.</em> 2014). Gill nets are significant threat to many marine mammals including dugongs (Read <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Moore <em>et al.</em> 2010, Pilcher <em>et al.</em> 2014). Some Dugong declines coincide with the introduction of monofilament nylon gill nets (Muir and Kizka 2012). However, it is often very difficult to convince the fishers or the fisheries managers to take the capture of Dugongs seriously. When Dugong population sizes are low, their capture in fisheries is a rare event, which becomes rarer as the Dugong population declines. Coastal development represents another important driver. Significant seagrass loss leads to Dugongs having reduced food resources, delayed reproduction and starvation (Marsh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011). The impact of chemical and noise pollution on Dugongs is unquantified. (Marsh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011).<br/><br/>Climate change is projected to lead to altered coastal environmental condition and increases in severe tropical storms and flood events that could affect both Dugongs and their seagrass habitats exacerbating the effects of the other drivers listed above (see Marsh <em>et al.</em> 2011 for details).","Archaeological evidence confirms exploitation of Dugongs by early humans. As long as 6,000 years ago, Dugongs on the small island of Akab in the United Arabian Emirates were hunted for food (Méry <em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Excavations in the Torres Strait, Australia, has revealed that Dugong hunting in this region dates back at least 4,000 years and possibly up to 7,000 years (Crouch <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Wright 2010) and that the harvest has been substantial for at least 400–500 years (McNiven and Bedingfield 2008).&#160;Although hunting is now legally banned in most countries, there are important exceptions for the subsistence use by traditional peoples. In Australia, the Dugong hunting rights of ‘Native Title Holders’ (indigenous people who can prove continuous connections to their traditional land and sea country) have been consistently upheld by the courts in a series of landmark decisions since 1993. Dugong hunting still has considerable cultural significance to coastal Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples across northern Australia, and Dugong meat is considered by these groups to be the one of the highest value traditional foods. Some subsistence Dugong hunting is also allowed in the Pacific states of Papua New Guinea (restrictions apply), Vanuatu and New Caledonia (restrictions apply), where Dugongs are still of great cultural and dietary significance.Commercial exploitation of Dugongs occurred intermittently at various places along the coast of Queensland, Australia, from 1847-1969 (Daley <em>et al</em>. 2008).&#160;Numerous products are still obtained from Dugongs and used for food, folk medicine, cooking/lubrication, aphrodisiacs, amulets/charms/jewellery, carvings, religious artefacts, leather products and other (Marsh <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Trade in Dugong (and all other sirenian) products is regulated or banned by the Convention for Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Dugongs are currently listed on CITES Appendix I.",English,6909
Palearctic,"<p>The majority of conservation actions historically in place for the European eel were set up and controlled at local and national level, often with little coordination which is of particular concern in relation to trans-boundary watersheds.<br/><br/>EMPs have been developed and implemented in EU Member States since the EC Regulation 1100/2007 was created to offer protection, promote recovery and increase of silver eel biomass and enhance the sustainable management of this species. The objective of each EMP is to reduce anthropogenic mortalities so as to permit, with high probability, the escapement to the sea of at least 40% of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influences had impacted the stock. Member States are responsible for implementing measures to achieve their targets, and these measures can include, but are not limited to; reducing commercial and recreational fisheries; restocking; improving habitats and making rivers passable; transportation of silver eels to the sea; reducing predation, amending hydro-electric power turbine schedules to reduce mortality, and developing aquaculture. According to the ICES WKEPEMP report (2013) &#160;most management actions have been for commercial and recreational fisheries, followed by hydropower-pumping stations obstacles, then measures on habitat, restocking, and predator control. Other actions expected to have indirect effects, such as implementing monitoring programmes and scientific studies, have been almost as common as controls on fisheries. A total of 756 management actions proposed in the EMPs have been implemented fully, 259 partially and 107 declared as not implemented at all (ICES WKEPEMP 2013).<br/><br/>In addition to EMPs, in 2007, the European eel was included in the CITES Appendix II in order to ensure trade of this commercially important species was sustainable. The listing came into effect on 13 March 2009, after which time all Parties to the Convention were required to issue permits for all exports of the species. An export permit may be issued only if the specimen was legally obtained and if the export is not detrimental to the survival of the species i.e. a Non-Detriment Finding. Finally in relation to international policy, in 2008, <em>A. anguilla</em> was added to the OSPAR List of Threatened and/or Declining Species in the Northeast Atlantic (OSPAR 2010).<br/><br/>As part of the EMPs, any Member State that allowed fishing for eels of &lt;12 cm total length – generally referred to as glass eel fisheries - &#160;was required to reserve a minimum of 35% of their catch for restocking purposes (i.e. restocking rivers with glass eels from elsewhere) in 2010, rising to 60% from 31 July 2013. Whether restocking programmes actually enhance the population is still open to debate. In recent years, the ICES WGEEL has annually assessed new information on the pros and cons of stocking as a suitable tool for eel recovery, with fuller reviews undertaken in 2006 and 2010 (ICES 2010). Recent reviews (WGEEL 2012, Pawson 2012) on the contribution of stocking for the recovery of the panmictic European eel population unambiguously state that there are major knowledge gaps to be filled before firm conclusions either way can be drawn (ICES WGEEL 2013). To inform this debate, however, researchers are currently seeking to determine whether stocked individuals are able to migrate as successfully and contribute to future generations to the same degree as wild individuals. Long term stocking, marking and monitoring programmes are slowly making progress in this endeavour (Wickström and Sjöberg 2013). A team of researchers in France suggest that the stage at which eels are stocked does not affect their survival (Desprez <em>et al</em>. 2013). Tagging and tracking studies, such as those being conducted as part of the EU EELIAD project, are under way in order to gain a better understanding of the marine ecology of the European Eel. Tracking is also adopted to determine the relative success of stocked eels to make spawning migrations and thus contribute to recruitment (e.g. Prigge <em>et al</em>. 2013a) and a recent paper indicates that eels from a stocked watershed migrate in a similar way to wild populations in Sweden (Westerberg <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). In summary however, until stocking studies are accompanied by suitable controls of areas without translocation, it is very difficult to determine whether there is a net increase in silver eel escapement or differences in growth rates and/or sex ratios in manipulated populations (Pawson 2012).<br/><br/>Trap and transport programmes across Europe are designed to provide eels with both upstream and downstream passage and/or access to habitat that has been lost through the construction of migratory barriers. These programmes that involve catching wild eels and moving them over relatively small distances past barriers are generally working with lower numbers of fish than restocking programmes and are very location specific. However, when applied to migrating silver eels, low in a catchment, it can have a significant and immediate effect on escapement thus potentially having a positive impact on the spawning stock. It is hoped that translocation can mitigate against the loss of habitat and positively contribute to enhanced escapement, and by association, recruitment. There is a necessity in the future, however, to reduce the level of direct human intervention by providing more cost-effective passes or ladders for eels to navigate.<br/><br/>Continuous monitoring of eel escapement on a national or international scale is currently very rare and highly unlikely and so in addition to localised monitoring, modelling has been explored for providing estimates of escapement in eel subpopulations. The German Eel Model indicated that current levels of silver eel escapement from the Schwentine River system showed ‘distinctly lower reference escapement values’ than those set by the German EMP (Prigge et al. 2013). Indeed a report for the European Commission by Walker <em>et al</em>. (2011) review a number of assessment models (namely the Demographic model of the Camargue (DemCam); Eel Density Analysis 2.0 (EDA); German Eel Model (GEM); and, Scenario-based Model of Eel Production II (SMEP II)) using time series eel data sets from a variety of locations across Europe. The conclusions of this report suggest that all four models were capable of predicting escapement to a degree of accuracy (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>In summary, the international assessment of the eel stock collated in the 2013 ICES WGEEL report confirms “the critical state of the stock; the promising increase in recruitment observed in the last two years is set in historical perspective; but no prediction can be generated, and no evaluation of the implemented stock protection measures achieved”. There is still a critical need for improvement in the quality and consistency of data reporting at the national and Eel Management Unit (EMU) level (ICES WGEEL 2013). Further, it is important to highlight that while conservation actions of varying effectiveness are in place for <em>Anguilla anguilla</em> across its range, more is still required, and the apparent rise in recruitment that has occurred in 2011, 2012 and 2013, should not be reason to cease efforts. It was proposed that reassessment of this species will be required in five years, or sooner should considerably more data on silver eel escapement become available in the next few years.</p><p></p>","<p><strong>Habitat: <br/></strong>The species is found in a range of habitats from small streams to large rivers and lakes, and in estuaries, lagoons and coastal waters. Under natural conditions, it only occurs in water bodies that are connected to the sea; it is stocked elsewhere.<br/><br/><strong>Ecology:&#160;<br/></strong>The species is facultatively catadromous, living in fresh, brackish and coastal waters but migrating to pelagic marine waters to breed. While there is some understanding of the eel’s continental life history, relatively little is known about its marine phase. The migrations in the European Eel’s life cycle are the longest and most oceanographically complex of the anguillid species (Tsukamoto <em>et al</em>. 2002). There are a number of phases in an eel’s life that have specific terminology; the leaf-shaped marine larval stage is referred to as leptocephalus; these become glass eels as they reach brackish water, before developing into the pigmented, growth phase: the yellow eel. The final stage is the marine-migratory silver eel which is characterised by silvery counter-shading and large eyes.<br/><br/>There are no exact data about specific spawning sites, however, it is proposed that spawning takes place in an elliptic zone, about 2,000 km wide in the Sargasso Sea, in the West Central Atlantic (about 26°N 60°W). Survey catches of leptocephalus larvae suggest that spawning peaks at the beginning of March continuing through until July (McCleave 1993). The adults are assumed to die after spawning. Oceanic migration of leptocephali is estimated to take about two years on average before they arrive at the continental shelf (Bonhommeau <em>et al.</em> 2008, Zenimoto <em>et al</em>. 2011). The mechanisms by which leptocephali reach the European and N. African coasts are also not well understood. The main migrations occur in late-autumn to early-spring in Iberian and Bay of Biscay waters, and they are delayed in more northerly sites until temperatures rise in the spring. &#160;By the time the leptocephali reach the continental slope they are as large as 100 mm in size and metamorphose into glass eels which are elongate and have a transparent body. These glass eels are observed in the summer and autumn on Portuguese coasts, and in winter and spring in the North Sea. <br/><br/>Glass eels enter freshwater as sexually undifferentiated individuals. Development and differentiation of the sexual organs are thought to be closely correlated with body size and associated with the yellowing phase of the eels life history. Sex determination is principally driven by environmental factors with density dependence producing more males at high densities (Davey and Jellyman 2005). Male European Eels initially grow faster than females, however, females achieve a greater age and size than males when sexually mature. Furthermore, the mean length increases significantly with latitude in females but not males, whereas age increases significantly in both (Durif <em>et al</em>. 2009, M. Aprahamian unpub. data). Male fitness is maximised by maturing at the smallest size that allows a successful spawning migration (a time minimising strategy) such that males tend to emigrate at a length of &lt;450 mm. Conversely, females adopt a more flexible size-maximising strategy prior to migration that trades off pre-reproductive mortality against fecundity (Davey and Jellyman 2005). There is considerable geographic variation in mean length at metamorphosis of male and female European Eels (Vøllestad 1992). Dekker <em>et al</em>. (1998) produced a paper describing the extreme sizes in each of the life stages of the European Eel from data at a long term capture locality in the Netherlands (Sizes (cm): Min – Max, Glass eels: 5.4 – 9.2, Yellow: 6.9 – 133.0, Silver (M): 21.2 – 44.4, Silver (F): 26.4 – 101.0). Driven by density dependence, there are often skewed sex ratios at individual localities as well as geographic bias associated with latitude.<br/><br/>Eel growth increases with temperature and growth rate is generally faster in saline water than fresh. Furthermore those individuals produced in saline waters usually contain lower loads of the swim bladder parasite, <em>Anguillicola crassus</em> and thus may have improved chances of reaching their spawning grounds (ICES/SGAESAW 2009). During maturation, dependent on size, European Eels feed off a variety of organisms including fish, amphipods and decapod crustaceans. In saline muddy-bottomed habitats eels forage on bivalves, shrimp and polychaete worms.<br/><br/>The age at which silver eels mature and undertake their spawning migration is hugely variable and dependent on latitude and temperature of the environment in which they have grown, physical barriers that block migration routes, growth rate and sex differences. From the data available, lower bound estimates for average length of the continental growth phase are approximately 3-8 years for males and 4-5 years for females and upper bound estimates approximately 12-15 years for males and 18-20 for females (Acou <em>et al</em>. 2003, Froese and Pauly 2005, Durif <em>et al</em>. 2009). Assessment of available data on generation length during the IUCN Red List process highlighted that defining a single figure for species such as eels was extremely difficult. Factors that can significantly affect this parameter include longitude and latitude, sex and habitat quality. Fifteen years was agreed upon after this analysis and it is important to indicate that this is inclusive of an estimated two year larval migration and 0.5 year spawning migration of silver eels.</p>",Done,"<p>A subset of the recruitment index data in the ICES WGEEL 2012 report was used for analysis i.e., data collected as part of fisheries independent scientific monitoring or fisheries dependent data with an associated metric of effort (e.g. catch per unit effort (CPUE)). Other data were kindly provided by Dr Brian Knights, and this was included as part of the assessment process. Catch effort can be variable in fishing data, and under-reporting and, in some cases, an absence of reporting of landings is a serious problem in most European countries. Thus landings data cannot be accepted as a precise measure of stock status. However, trends in the reported catch data will, to some extent, reflect true changes in fishing yields. All the data were analysed to assess trends in recruitment, population and spawner escapement; however, it was primarily used to guide discussions that resulted in the broad agreement of the Critically Endangered listing by the assessment team, which was in turn supported by the majority of reviewers.<br/><br/>There are more data available for <em>A. anguilla</em> in northern, central and southern European countries compared to North Africa, however there is considerably less freshwater habitat available to the European Eel in this part of its range. For analytical purposes the North Sea subpopulation is often referred to in separate terms to the rest of Europe by ICES. This is because the decline in abundance of <em>A. anguilla </em>has been shown to be substantially greater for this area compared to anywhere else (ICES WGEEL 2012), although this declining trend can be mostly accounted for during the period between 1980 and 1985.<br/><br/>Determining changes in the international stock in anguillid eels is difficult due to limited data and the poor understanding of the relationship between recruitment, freshwater populations, and escapement. Not only is there a huge time lag between the recruitment of glass eels to fresh and brackish water and the subsequent escapement of silver eels, but given that A. anguilla are panmictic, escapement from one area does not translate directly into returning larval recruitment at the same locality. Indeed for all intents and purposes it is assumed that practically nothing is known about the dynamics of the oceanic phase of A. anguilla (ICES WGEEL 2013). It has been proposed that due to the relatively short time-span between spawning and recruitment that the latter is a good indicator of the past spawning stock that produced the juvenile cohort; this will depend, to an extent, on the significance of oceanic factors on larval transport.<br/><br/>Assessment of these datasets using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria took into account, where this information was available, consistency of sampling; longevity of the data set; whether they were eel-specific or multi-species; whether the collection methods were active or passive; whether the watershed the data related to was subject to restocking activity; and/or whether, in the case of fisheries independent data, there was exploitation in the region.</p><p><strong><br/>Glass and Yellow Eel Recruitment:&#160;<br/></strong>The glass eel data sets used in the analyses for this IUCN Red List assessment were from The Netherlands, Sweden, Ireland, France, and Spain. The elver data sets used were from Norway, Sweden, Ireland and Denmark. These data sets were a mix of fisheries CPUE and scientific surveys and as many were drawn from the WGEEL 2012 report it is unsurprising that they reflect the findings of this document, and they are discussed in this context below.<br/><br/>Since the early 1980s, a steady and almost continent wide decline of ~90% has been observed in the recruitment of glass eels. Recently, the WGEEL recruitment index (five year average) fell to its lowest historical level: less than 1% for the North Sea and 5% elsewhere in the distribution area with respect to recruitment from between 1960–1979 (ICES WGEEL 2012). In the last two years however, the recruitment index has increased to 1.5% of the 1960–1979 reference level in the ‘North Sea’ series, and to 10% in the ‘Elsewhere’ series, but both remain far from ‘healthy’ (ICES WGEEL 2013). This could possibly be in response to the closure of silver eel fisheries across Europe in 2009, although this increase is within the natural variation of historical records (ICES WGEEL 2012). Whilst data from catch returns indicate this increase in recruitment, the impact of the overall decline will likely continue to influence adult stock for at least one generation length (ICES WGEEL 2012). Furthermore, the use of fisheries data makes it difficult to assess the full extent of this recent increase in recruitment due to a lack of effort metrics for some data sets and the introduction of quotas which, once reached and fishing ceases, provide no way of estimating subsequent arrivals to coastal freshwater habitat.<br/><br/><strong>Yellow Eel: </strong><br/>Data sets used to assess yellow eel populations were from Sweden, Norway, Ireland, the UK, the Netherlands and France and were a mix of scientific fishing surveys, electrofishing and fisheries. It was raised that some of the Swedish sites may have exhibited less pronounced declines, and in some cases even increases in population, due to stocking (Wickström 1983, Neuman <em>et al</em>. 1990, Andersson <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>While the decline in yellow eel populations was not as severe as that of recruitment, the available data indicated that it was greater than 50% over three generations (45 years). It is very likely that the less pronounced decline will be partially due to density dependent mortality (Svedäng 1999). However, it needs to be taken into account that the age range of yellow eels is broad and that there may very well be a time lag in knock-on population effects. As such, any increase in recruitment would not be expected to be immediately mirrored in a rise in yellow eel numbers, indeed, it is possible that this life stage may continue to decline.<br/><br/><strong>Silver Eels: <br/></strong>The data sets on silver eel escapement were from France, Norway, Ireland and Sweden and were collected from scientific surveys and fisheries.<br/><br/>Silver eel decline was not as pronounced as yellow eel populations or recruitment but, similar to yellow eels, the indication was that the decline across the range was greater than 50% over three generations. Again, this may be due to density dependent mortality at previous life stages, but it cannot be ruled out that a decline in silver eel escapement may continue despite increases in glass eels and/or yellow eels due to the long generation time.<br/><br/>The EU regulation 1100/2007 – article 2.4 states “The objective of each [EU] Eel Management Plan shall be to reduce anthropogenic mortalities so as to permit with high probability the escapement to the sea of at least 40 % of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influences had impacted the stock”. According to the ICES WKEPEMP report, assigned to evaluate the current progress of the Europe-wide EMPs, out of 81 eel management units (EMUs), 17 EMU are reported as achieving their biomass targets, 42 are not and 22 did not report (WKEPEMP 2013). In southern Norway, sharp declines in abundance have been observed since 2000 after relatively long periods of stability (ICES WGEEL 2012).<br/><br/><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> has been included in a number of regional and national Red List assessments in Europe over the past 10 years. The European Eel has been assessed as Critically Endangered across Europe (Freyhof and Brooks 2011) as well as in Sweden (Gärdenfors 2005), Denmark (NERI 2009), France (UICN 2010) Norway (Kålås <em>et al</em>. 2010), and Ireland (King <em>et al</em>. 2011) and in regional assessments for the Baltic Sea area (HELCOM 2007) and north Belgium (Verreycken <em>et al</em>. 2013). Indeed the European Eel showed the largest negative population trend of any of the freshwater fishes (-75%) in the Belgian report (Verreycken <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>For the North African range of the population there is considerably less information. A regional Red List assessment in North Africa suggests that <em>A. anguilla</em> is Endangered due to a decline in recruitment of 50% in the last 10 years with annual catches declining by between 10 and 25% since the 1980s, and by more in Tunisia alone (Azeroual 2010).</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> has been shown to be distributed from North Cape in Northern Norway, southwards along the coast of Europe, all coasts of the Mediterranean and on the North African Coast (Schmidt 1909, Dekker 2003). It very rarely enters the White and Barents seas, but it has been recorded eastward to the Pechora River in northwest Russia. The species occurs in low abundance in the Black Sea where it migrates east to the Kuban drainage (occasional individuals reach the Volga drainage through canals), in northern Scandinavia and eastern Europe. A report by the ICES Study Group on Anguillid Eels in Saline Waters (SGAESAW) indicates that eel populations typically contain a mix of freshwater residents, saline water residents, and inter‐habitat migrants (ICES/SGAESAW 2009). It also widely occurs in most inland waters of Europe (e.g. lakes). It is thought that the continental distribution of the European Eel is over an area of approximately 90,000 km²&#160;in Europe and parts of North Africa (Moriarty and Dekker 1997), with a substantially larger range if their marine distribution is considered. For example, in England and Wales, there are thought to be a total of 2,694 km²&#160;of transitional waters, which account for approximately 68% of the potential eel producing habitat across all 11 River Basin Districts (Defra 2010).</p><p></p><p>    For several decades prior to an EU-wide ban on export in 2010, <em>A. anguilla</em> was also exported to Asia for seed stock in eel farms (Ringuet <em>et al</em>. 2002). This species may well have been introduced in some parts of Asia (through escape or release from farms), however these are not thought to contribute to the population and therefore areas of introduction have been excluded in the range information. <em>Anguilla anguilla</em> are thought to spawn in the Sargasso Sea in the West Central Atlantic between late winter and early spring, before eggs hatch and leptocephalus larvae migrate back across the Atlantic to begin the continental phase of their life history (Schmidt 1912, Aarestrup <em>et al</em>. 2009).</p><p><br/></p>",28/05/2013,3.1,,true,CR,,"A2bd+4bd",false,false,,"<p><em>Anguilla anguilla</em> exhibits facultative catadromy, has multiple life stages, and is semelparous and panmictic; these life history traits made application of the IUCN Red List criteria more challenging. Anguillids are often referred to as ‘freshwater eels’, however, it is known that they can exhibit inter-habitat migration and that a proportion may stay in estuaries, lagoons and coastal waters, rarely, if ever, entering freshwater: this element of the population is particularly poorly understood.</p><p>Ideally, the IUCN Red List criteria would be applied to mature eels at their spawning grounds, and in the absence of such data, the criteria would be applied to silver eels starting their spawning migration (in the case of European Eels, leaving ‘continental’ waters), as these represent the maximum estimate of spawning stock biomass, but data sets for this are very rare. The majority of available data relates to glass eels and yellow eels but the relationships between recruitment, yellow eel populations, silver eel escapement, and spawner stock biomass are poorly understood. As such, the IUCN Red List criteria have to be applied to an amalgamation of multiple life stages, which may not exactly mirror the mature spawning stock but can be used as the current best estimate. Finally, the European Eel is a panmictic species, i.e. they come from one spawning stock. Taken literally, this assumes equal importance of the continental populations, and as such escapement from a specific river/country/region is not equivalent to the subsequent recruitment as this relies on the spawning stock as a whole, irrespective of escapement location. However, there are hypotheses that certain regions may have greater importance for the spawning stock, e.g. males primarily escaping from North Africa (Kettle <em>et al</em>. 2011), and as data are only available from certain parts of the species' range - data are particularly sparse for Mediterranean and North African populations - it is important that conservation initiatives and management actions are adjusted as new data become available.&#160;</p><p>In relation to&#160;<em>A. anguilla</em>, only a very small amount of data are available for silver eels, and while this is not geographically representative of the stock as a whole, a cursory analysis of this alone indicates that the mean decline in silver eel escapement is estimated to be 50-60% over the period of three generations (45 years), just placing them in the Endangered category. There is a similar dearth and uneven geographical spread in the data that relates to yellow eels; however, taking these limitations into account, analysis indicates that there has been a slightly greater decline in this life stage compared to silver eels. Compounding these declines in escapement of maturing eels, according to the available data, there has been substantial declines (90-95%) in recruitment of the European Eel across wide areas of its geographic range during the period of the last 45 years (or three generations) due to a range of threats facing freshwater eels at multiple life history stages. Recruitment has fluctuated during the last century. However, the analysis carried out as part of the IUCN Red List assessment mirrors the WGEEL recruitment index (five year average) which, despite increases in recruitment during the last few years, is currently at its lowest historical level of 1-10% the recruitment of the 1980s, (ICES WGEEL 2013). Further, there is concern that due to the period of time eels spend feeding and growing, prior to silvering and migrating to spawn, that silver eels may continue to decline, even if recruitment is showing recovery.</p><p>There is a suite of threats that have been implicated in causing the decline in European Eel recruitment and stocks: barriers to migration – including damage by hydropower turbines; poor body condition; climate change and/or changes in oceanic currents; disease and parasites (particularly&#160;<em>Anguillicola crassus</em>); exploitation and trade of glass, yellow and silver eels; changing hydrology; habitat loss; pollutants; and predation.&#160;The impact of these threats individually or synergistically, are likely regionally specific; however, more broadly, climate and ocean currents have been suggested to play an important role in the survival and transport of the leptocephalus larvae and recruitment of glass eels to coastal, brackish and freshwater habitat. Further research is required to fully understand the complexities of this particular aspect of the eel's life history but there are conflicting opinions as to the degree, if any, which oceanic factors contribute to broad fluctuations in eel numbers.</p><p>Eel Management Plans (EMPs) have been developed in European countries since 2007 as a stipulation of the EU Council Regulation No 1100/2007 relating to the recovery of the European Eel. Currently, more than 50% of the 81 EMP progress reports across Europe are failing to meet their target silver eel biomass escapement of 40% in accordance with the regulation, indicating that more work is required (WKEPEMP 2013). Further,&#160;international regulation was enforced for this species&#160;in 2007 when CITES (the&#160;Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species&#160;of Wild Fauna and Flora)&#160;listed&#160;<em>A. anguilla</em>&#160;on Appendix II (this came into force in March 2009).&#160;Since this time, exports outside of Europe have been banned due to concern over the decline in recruitment and stocks, however, trade continues within the EU and from non-EU countries within its range to other non-EU countries.</p><p>A number of management measures are being implemented in line with EMPs,&#160;for example easing of barriers. The influence of these measures, however, will take time to determine as they have only very recently been implemented and very much focus on the freshwater component of the eel's life-history. Arguably the most widely practised measure is restocking; however, there remains a great deal of debate as to whether this benefits eel spawning stocks and thus enhanced future recruitment.&#160;Measures that apply to silver eels, such as fisheries management, and/or trap and transport programmes, can theoretically have an almost immediate effect on the potential spawning stock, although when carried out in isolation, their benefit is significantly reduced.<br/></p><p>As stated above, the relationship between life-stages is poorly understood, but it was generally agreed that it is very likely that the low recruitment will ultimately translate, though not linearly, to reduced future escapement for, at best, one generation length (15 years). Further, low recruitment has been proposed to be indicative of low historical breeding stock due to the relatively short time period (~2 years) between spawning and subsequent glass eel abundance. As such it was deemed appropriate to assign&#160;<em>A. anguilla</em>&#160;a Critically Endangered listing under current observations and future projected reductions of mature individuals (A2bd+4bd).</p><p>While this status is unchanged from the previous assessment, it is important to highlight that the process of this designation was very different in that it was carried out as part of an anguillid specific workshop, and that new data were incorporated – for example the generation length was reduced. There was general agreement that the situation had improved, albeit slightly, for this species both as far as recruitment and implementation of management measures was concerned. As such it is imperative to highlight that this listing is borderline, and that if the recently observed increase in recruitment continues, management actions relating to anthropogenic threats prove effective, and/or there are positive effects of natural influences on the various life stages of this species, a listing of Endangered would be achievable. Further, a drive to fill data gaps – particular in relation to the southern range of this species – would allow an even more robust assessment, and we strongly recommend an update of the status in five years.</p><p>                </p><p>Assessment of this species was carried out during a workshop held at the Zoological Society of London from July 1st-5th, 2013.</p>",Same category and criteria,,,,No change,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>The causes of the declining recruitment rates are still not fully understood (Dekker 2007), and while there are many hypotheses, the significance of any single threat, or the synergy it may have with other threats is still poorly understood. It is important to highlight, however, that management measures focusing on a single threat, in isolation of other identified pressures (listed below), are less likely to have a significant positive effects on eel numbers. The assessment process and accompanying external review indicated that a comprehensive discussion of these threats and their impacts was significantly beyond the scope of this assessment – there is a significant body of information including a great deal of contradiction in peer-reviewed and grey literature, and in expert opinion relating to these threats. Below we list (in alphabetical order) suspected threats with some (but not all) key references and a very brief synopsis of these threats – this is by no means comprehensive and does not attempt to fully dissect the wide range of views and data on these pressures. As such, a robust and comprehensive analysis of the existing data and opinion on factors linked to decline in abundance of the European Eel would be extremely timely.<br/><br/>Barriers to migration – including damage by hydropower turbines - Winter <em>et al</em>. 2006, Acou <em>et al</em>. 2008, Azeroual 2010, van der Meer 2012.<br/><br/>Body condition - Boëtius and Boëtius 1980, Svedäng and Wickström 1997, van Ginneken and van den Thillart 2000.<br/><br/>Climate change and/or changes in oceanic currents (including the influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)) - Castonguay et al. 1994, Dekker 2004, Kim <em>et al</em>. 2004, Minegishi <em>et al.</em> 2005, Bonhommeau <em>et al</em>. 2008, Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009, Durif <em>et al</em>. 2011, Pacariz <em>et al</em>. 2013.<br/><br/>Disease and parasites (particularly <em>Anguillicola crassus</em>) - De Charleroy <em>et al</em> 1990, Würtz and Taraschewski 2000, Vettier <em>et al</em>. 2003, van Ginneken <em>et al</em>. 2004, Gollock <em>et al</em>. 2005, Palstra <em>et al</em>. 2007, Sjöberg <em>et al</em>. 2009, Haenen <em>et al</em>. 2012.<br/><br/>Exploitation and trade of glass, yellow and silver eels - ICES WGEEL 2012, 2013; Crook 2010; Crook and Nakamura 2013.<br/><br/>Hydrology – e.g. Kettle <em>et al</em>. 2011.<br/><br/>Habitat loss – e.g. Feunteun 2002.<br/><br/>Pollutants - Robinet and Feunteun 2002, Maes <em>et al.</em> 2005, Palstra <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Geeraerts and Belpaire 2010.<br/><br/>Predation – e.g. Carpentier <em>et al</em>. 2009, DEFRA 2010, Wahlberg <em>et al</em>. 2014.<br/><br/><strong>Summary:</strong> <br/>One of the major threats to European Eel populations, like many anguillid species, is barriers to upstream and downstream migration, which also includes mortality by hydropower turbines and their associated screens and water management systems. Across Europe, there are a total of 24,350 hydropower plants and this figure is set to rise in the near future (van der Meer 2012). Indeed, in the Netherlands alone there are a total of 4,671 water pumping stations which inhibit the spawning migrations of adult silver eels downstream and the upstream migration of young glass eels. Degradation and loss of available habitat is also exacerbated by development, flood control, water-level management and the abstraction of surface and ground water for both domestic and commercial (e.g. agricultural) use. In North Africa, the declines in fisheries catches of all eel life history stages (but glass eel in particular) have been attributed to over-exploitation, dam construction, pollution of estuaries and water abstraction for domestic use (Azeroual 2010). It is proposed that the decline in good quality habitat and associated resources may be causing a decline in body condition of escaping silver eels in parts of the range which may have effects on the success of migration and/or spawning due this species’, particularly the female’s, reliance on fat stores for reproductive success.<br/><br/>In relation to this, the accumulation of lipophilic chemical pollutants by maturing eels could have potentially toxic effects on migrating adults. These chemicals are stored by the fish and released when fat stores are broken down during migration which could subsequently limit the capacity of the silver eels to complete their spawning migrations due to metabolic disruption (Robinet and Feunteun 2002, Palstra <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). Further, there is concern that even if the spawning migration is completed that lipid stores containing xenobiotics may result in disrupted gonadogenesis and/or low quality gametes (Robinet and Feunteun 2002).<br/><br/>Climate change has been proposed to play a role in fluctuations of abundance in <em>A. anguilla</em> – particularly larval transport and glass eel recruitment - through its impact on the suspected breeding grounds (Sargasso Sea) and on changing oceanic conditions that can influence the recruitment of glass eels to near shore and freshwater environments. An important consideration in this discussion is the time scale over which changes are thought to occur as a result of oceanic conditions. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the associated climate variability that this brings to the North Atlantic have been dated as far back as the Holocene (Kim <em>et al</em>. 2004). As such, fluctuations in climate do occur naturally and have been influencing eel populations for millions of years (Minegishi et al 2005) during periods of increase and decline.<br/><br/>The NAO has been studied as a driver of recruitment in both the European and American eel, with published literature arguing for and against this hypothesis. Durif <em>et al</em>. (2011) indicated that periods of high NAO appear to negatively correlate with recruitment to freshwater habitats due to the metamorphosis of larvae into glass eels being impeded by the larvae being driven into colder water, slowing the process considerably. Further, changing ocean climate might potentially be responsible for fluctuations in productivity and thus food availability for leptocephali (Miller <em>et al</em>. 2009). Pacariz <em>et al</em>. (2014), however, found that the overall success of drift of larvae from the spawning ground to the East Atlantic was not affected by changes in climate between 1958-2008, suggesting that trends in recruitment are attributable to factors other than changing currents, a theory also supported by Henderson <em>et al</em>. (2012). As such, the most recent WGEEL report claims that there is still practically nothing known about the dynamics of the oceanic phase of the eels life history (ICES WGEEL 2013).<br/><br/>The parasite nematode (<em>Anguillicola crassus</em>), introduced when the Japanese Eel (<em>A. japonica</em>) was imported to Europe for culture in the early 1980s, is also thought to impact the ability of the European Eel to reach their spawning grounds due to its negative influence on the fitness traits associated with the silvering stage of maturation (Fazio <em>et al</em>. 2012) in addition to swimbladder damage which impairs swimming performance (Palstra <em>et al</em>. 2007) and the ability to cope with high pressure during their reproductive migration (Vettier <em>et al</em>. 2003, Sjöberg <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Overfishing of glass - fisheries are primarily in France, with the UK and Spain also contributing -, yellow and silver eels across Europe is also a threat to the species. Across its distribution all continental life history stages of the European Eel are currently exploited although data from different regions varies in quality and longevity. Export outside of Europe is now banned with any trade occurring within Europe (for consumption, culture and stocking) and quotas are in place, however, under-reporting, poaching and illegal trade are believed to occur throughout the range of the European eel fisheries. These activities endanger the species and make assessment of the impact of this fishery difficult, and it’s associated management problematic.<br/><br/>Given the relative lack of understanding of the threats we have attempted to quantify this using the IUCN ‘Threat Classification Scheme’, however, this is by no means definitive.</p>","<p>The various life stages, ranging from glass eel to silver eel, of all <em>Anguilla</em> species are harvested and traded on a global scale for consumption - directly or after culture - and for stocking purposes, with current demand predominantly driven by East Asian markets, in particular Japan and mainland China. A concerning pattern of exploitation is already apparent – when one <em>Anguilla</em> species or population declines in abundance or new catch/trade measures come into force limiting exploitation levels, industry moves to the next in order to fulfil demand (Crook and Nakamura 2013).<br/><br/>There is clear evidence for this in the case of European Eel. Traditionally, European Eel was consumed within its European and North African range States – yellow and silver eels were fished for direct consumption, and glass eels were caught for farming and also for consumption (mainly in Spain). Although still consumed within Europe, in recent decades European eel became increasingly important in fulfilling demand in East Asia (Ringuet <em>et al.</em>&#160;2002).<br/><br/>Eel farming, which is responsible for over 90% of all <em>Anguilla</em> production worldwide (averaging at 280,000 tonnes per year since 2007; FAO 2013), is reliant on wild-caught juvenile eels or glass eels. Raising European eel larvae to the glass eel stage in captivity has never been achieved, and while it has for the Japanese eel, this is not yet commercially viable. Historically, eel farms used species of local provenance. France, Spain, Portugal and the UK were the principal fishing nations for European Eel glass eels, and Italy, Denmark and the Netherlands the main producers of farmed European Eel, for consumption within Europe. However, towards the end of the 1990s, a decline in stocks of Japanese eels, combined with the apparently cheap and abundant supplies of European Eel glass eels, led to many Asian eel farms in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and mainland China, switching to the European eel for their culture material (Ringuet <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>Concerns over the impact international trade was having on European Eel led to it being listed in Appendix II of CITES in 2007. This listing came into force on 13 March 2009 – since then any international trade in this species needs to be accompanied by a permit. In December 2010, however, the European Union (EU) decided to ban all imports and exports of European Eel to and from the EU, as authorities felt they were unable to determine that trade would not be detrimental to the conservation of the species (a requirement for issuance of permits for CITES Appendix II-listed species). Exceptions to this ban included trade in pre-Convention specimens i.e. those fished prior to the CITES listing coming into force (permitted until April 2012) and internal EU trade. Trade from non-EU range States to non-EU countries is also still permitted (Crook 2011).<br/><br/>Fishing of various life stages continues in a number of European Eel range States, but in most cases catch is being limited by quotas or other measures set as part of National Eel Management Plans (fulfilling requirements outlined in Council Regulation (EC) No.1100/2007 establishing measures for the recovery of the stock of the European Eel (18 September 2007) – see conservation measures).<br/><br/><em>Anguilla</em> spp. are traded internationally as live eels for farming and consumption, as fresh, frozen and smoked/prepared eels for consumption and as skins and leather products for fashion accessories. Global trade data collated by FAO for live, fresh, frozen and smoked/prepared <em>Anguilla</em> species (non-species specific) is available for the period 1976-2009. According to FAO data, global annual Anguilla exports averaged around 20,000 tonnes in the late 1970s (valued annually at 55-95 million US Dollars), after which annual exports showed a steady increase to a maximum of over 130,000 tonnes in 2000 (valued at over 1000 million US Dollars). Since then annual exports have been declining, to just over 80,000 tonnes in 2008 and 2009 (valued at over 800 million US Dollars). By weight, China and Taiwan are responsible for nearly 75% of these exports and Japan for over 75% of all imports (FAO 2013).<br/><br/>Due to a lack of species-specific Customs data, the actual quantities of European Eel in trade is still relatively unknown. However, East Asian Customs imports of live juvenile <em>Anguilla</em> eels from European eel range States for farming purposes (defined as “live eel fry” in East Asia) can provide a good indication of the amount of European glass eels in trade (due to their delicate nature and the need for quick transportation to their destination). Between 2003 and 2008, annual live eel fry imports from European eel range States to mainland China, Taiwan, Korea, Japan and Hong Kong fluctuated between ~36 and 70 tonnes. In 2009, annual imports dropped to ~9 tonnes, in 2010 they increased again to nearly 28 tonnes and in 2011 and 2012 were ~7 and ~5 tonnes respectively - these low numbers are a result of the EU ban in place since 2011. Consequently, increasing quantities of glass eels of other Anguilla species are being imported into East Asia to fulfil demand in farms (Crook 2010; Crook and Nakamura 2013, V. Crook/TRAFFIC 2014, in litt/pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Furthermore, since 2009, species-specific CITES trade data for European eel has been reported. Between 2009 -2011, over 360 tonnes of live eels (including 20 tonnes of juvenile eels for farming) were reportedly exported from a number of European Eel range States. Exporters included Algeria, Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, France, Greece, Morocco, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, Tunisia and the UK,and importers included Armenia, &#160;mainland China, Denmark, France, Hong Kong, Italy, Macedonia, the Netherlands, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Spain, Sweden, Tunisia and Ukraine. During these three years, nearly 30,000 tonnes of <em>A. anguilla</em> meat and bodies were also reportedly exported (mostly from farms in mainland China), in addition to ~11,000 leather products and ~13,000 skins (mostly from Mexico, but originating in Korea) (UNEP-WCMC 2013). Since December 2010, illegal trade in European eel has been a concern – authorities have seized several European glass eel shipments destined for East Asian eel farms, in particular coming from Spain and France (TRAFFIC 2012, Crook in litt, 2013).<br/><br/><em><strong>Note:</strong> double-counting, under-reporting and misreporting must be taken into consideration when interpreting all available catch and trade data.

It is hoped that the exclusion of feral cattle, in addition to on-going rat baiting, will lead to greater regeneration at this site. The St Helena Government’s Terrestrial Conservation Section also operates a seed collection and storage programme to aid future conservation work. Gumwood seed is also stored within the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew’s Millennium Seed Bank initiative.<br/><br/>Large-scale plantings have been made at both Peak Dale and Deep Valley to supplement numbers, and at other sites of varying ‘wildness’ (e.g. at Knotty Ridge, Horse Ridge, Longwood and the Millennium Forest). Except where subject to reasonably intensive management, survival of the transplanted individuals has been poor, principally due to competition with invasive species. The Millennium Forest is the most important of the initiatives. This community-led restoration site near Horse Point is currently run by the St Helena National Trust, with the aim of restoring 250 hectares of Gumwood woodland near the site of the lost Great Wood. The Great Wood was a Gumwood-dominated forest that once covered large swathes of the eastern side of the island. It had largely disappeared as a result of livestock grazing and timber harvesting by the mid 1700s, but fragments survived until the early 20<sup>th</sup> Century. Since 2000, over 10,000 trees have been planted across approximately 35 hectares at the Millennium Forest site, with plantings of other endemic species such as Dwarf Ebony (<em>Trochetiopsis ebenus </em>Cronk) occurring more recently. Survival rates have been moderately good, and many of the trees are now flowering although few currently exceed 2.5m in height. Abundant seedling germination has been recorded in some places, but none of the new generation have currently reached maturity and as the forest is currently managed (e.g. by weeding, watering and translocation of natural seedlings) it is debatable whether the progeny can be considered “wild” for some time.<br/><br/>Gumwoods are also planted in school endemic gardens, and in private gardens and other sites around the island. A commercial plantation for craft timber has also been established at Thompson’s Hill.</p>","<p>A species of St Helena’s mid-altitudinal range. Several sources of evidence suggest that dense Gumwood forest once covered extensive areas of the island. Gumwood occupied moderately damp soils up to 600 m elevation, but also extended across drier plateaus and ridges down to 400 m, showing substantial resilience to dry conditions. Numerous isolated individuals persisted on cliffs and rocky outcrops well into the 1800s, though few remain today.<br/><br/>Gumwood flowers in sporadic bursts throughout the year, particularly in winter, with the timing probably linked to rainfall. The pendulous flowers are visited by a range of small insects but the endemic hoverfly <em>Loveridgeana beattiei</em> (Doesburg &amp; Doesburg) is particularly common. The light, windblown achenes spread reasonably efficiently and germinate in large numbers during winter where suitable conditions exist, even on arid land.<br/><br/>Gumwood supports a number of endemic invertebrate species, several of which are now very rare or, in a few cases, perhaps extinct.</p>",Done,"<p>A census conducted in 2013 – 14 calculated the wild Gumwood population at 679 mature trees through direct counts at each wild site, with 97.6% of the total world population contained within the Peak Dale site, and the remaining 2.4% at Deep Valley.<br/><br/>The previous Red List assessment estimated the population in 2003 approximately 1,000 trees, including at two localities (Longwood and Marias) which have now disappeared (Cairns-Wicks 2003). The results of the recent census therefore show a decline in the wild population over the past 11 years.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The extent of occurrence (EOO), based on the area of a minimum convex polygon around known localities, is 20.4 km<sup>2</sup>. The area of occupancy (AOO), based on a 2 km × 2 km grid, is 8 km<sup>2</sup>.<br/><br/>The Gumwood is found in the wild at only two sites, with a larger subpopulation at Peak Dale and smaller sub-population at Deep Valley. All other specimens on the island have been planted, although there is one tree at Thompson’s Wood of uncertain provenance. The total area of habitat occupied is approximately 1.63 ha.</p>",31/07/2015,3.1,,false,EN,,"B1ab(v)+2ab(v)",false,false,,"<p>Although planted as an ornamental and landscaping tree in various parts of the island, Gumwood (<em>Commidendrum robustum</em> <span class=""authorship"">(Roxb.) DC.) is now restricted to just two truly wild localities. The range is much less than 100 km<sup>2</sup> and the area of occupancy is under 10 km<sup>2</sup>. We also consider that the species meets two further requirements of criterion B:</p>  <p>(a) The population can be considered severely fragmented as the two extant sites are highly isolated from each other and juveniles are apparently unable to establish in the surrounding habitat.</p>  <p>(b) Direct evidence of a decline is limited as previous census data do not date back beyond the current generation of trees. However, we infer that future declines in the number of mature individuals are inevitable based on the similar age structure of the surviving population (most trees are now reasonably old), and low levels of regeneration at the existing sites. There has also been an observed loss of some scattered remnant wild trees from outlying localities over the past few decades.<br/><br/>In the previous Red List assessment, Cairns-Wicks (2003) classified Gumwood as Endangered B1ab(iii,iv). Direct declines have been relatively limited since this time, but data have been accumulated to demonstrate the severe problems of recruitment, which makes the conservation plight more pressing. The upgrade of the threat status to Critically Endangered ultimately results from the citing of severe fragmentation for the first time, but the new categorization seems merited on wider grounds.</p>",,,,Since first assessent,Genuine Change,Terrestrial,"<p>The vast tracts of Gumwood woodland largely disappeared in well under a century following the establishment of a permanent British colony on St Helena in 1659. The principle cause of the losses were probably land clearances to make way for pasture, and the felling of trees for firewood and (less suitably) for timber. At the same time, foliage was browsed by goats (<em>Capra hircus</em>) and seedlings uprooted by the numerous wild pigs (<em>Sus domesticus</em>) and cattle (<em>Bos taurus</em>). These large vertebrate herbivores have now largely been eradicated on the island.<br/><br/>There is little regeneration of the species in the wild. At the Peak Dale site this is mainly due to widespread damage to seedlings by feral cattle, apart from a small fenced section on private land and another fenced section managed by the St Helena Government’s Terrestrial Conservation Section. Regeneration is also hampered by invasion of the understorey by weeds; a continuous ground layer prevents the light, wind-blown achenes from reaching the ground. The trees are also prone to damage from rats which bark the trees for their gummy sap, and Rabbits (<em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em>)&#160;which graze the Gumwood seedlings. With little natural regeneration and&#160;the majority of the mature specimens being of approximately the same age and relatively old,&#160;it is not difficult to infer a current and future continuing decline in the number of mature individuals in the population. Gumwood habitat is also under severe threat from competition by invasive species, particularly wild mango (<em>Schinus terebinthifolia&#160;</em>Raddi) at Peak Dale.<br/><br/>Cairns-Wicks (2003) also noted that approximately 10% of the total population at Peak Dale was lost in the early 1990s as a result of Jacaranda Bug (<em>Insign</em>o<em>rthezia insignis</em>&#160;(Browne)). The predatory ladybird <em>Hyperaspis pantherina</em> Fürsch was subsequently released as a biocontrol agent and this was successful at suppressing the outbreaks. However, Jacaranda Bug is still common on the trees and periodic population surges are of some concern. It is likely that the problem still contributes to low levels of mortality in combination with other stresses. Even in the absence of sap-sucking pests, the plants produce gummy exudates which may be colonized by black sooty moulds, coating the leaves and reducing photosynthesis. It is not known whether the sooty moulds are a recent introduction or if this is a long-standing, natural phenomenon.</p>","<p>The species has been used in the past for timber and fuel. Currently used for craft products including photo frames, with potential for more of this kind of utilization in the future.<br/><br/>The Gumwood was recognized in 1977 as St Helena’s national tree.</p>",English,37583
