Cashew apple juice is said to be effective for the treatment of syphilis. Root infusion is an excellent purgative. Old cashew liquor in small doses cures stomach-ache. The oil obtained from the shell by maceration in spirit is applied to cure cracks on the sole of the feet, common in villagers. Cashew apple is anti-scorbutic, astringent and diuretic, and is used for cholera and kidney troubles. Bark is astringent, counterirritant, rubefacient, vesicant, and used for ulcer. Cashew nut shell oil is anti-hypertensive and purgative; it is used for blood sugar problems, kidney troubles, cholera, cracks on soles of feet, hookworms, corns and warts. The kernel is a demulcent, an emollient and is used for diarrhoea. Buds and young leaves are used for skin diseases. The resinous juice of seeds is used for mental derangement, heart palpitation, rheumatism; it was used to cure the loss of memory that was a sequel to smallpox. | Alcohol: In Brazil, Mozambique and Indonesia cashew wine (slightly fermented juice) is enjoyed at harvest time and can be distilled to produce strong alcoholic drinks. In Goa, India, fermenting the juice makes a type of brandy called ?fenni?. In Tanzania | Gum or resin: The bark contains an acrid sap of thick brown resin, which becomes black on exposure to air. This is used as indelible ink in marking and printing linens and cottons. The resin is also used as a varnish, a preservative for fishnets and a fl | Fibre: Pulp from the wood is used to fabricate corrugated and hardboard boxes. | Timber: The wood of A. occidentale (?white mahogany? in Latin America) is fairly hard with a density of 500 kg/cm. It finds useful applications in wheel hubs, yoke, fishing boats, furniture, false ceilings and interior decoration. Boxes made from the wood are collapsible but are strong enough to compete with conventional wooden packing cases. | Lipids: An oil, cashew nut shell liquid, is produced in the large cells of the pericarp; it has industrial applications and is used as a preservative to treat, for instance, wooden structures and fishing nets. It is also in good demand for paints, synthetic resins, laminated products, brake linings and clutch facings. | The wood is popular for firewood and charcoal. The residue of the shell is often used as fuel in cashew nut shell liquid extraction plants. | Because of its extreme tolerance of external conditions, it has been planted in poor soils to check erosion. | A. occidentale is cultivated for its nuts. Botanically, the nut is the fruit; the cashew apple is the swollen, fleshy fruit stalk. The seeds kernels are extracted by shelling the roasted nuts. In production areas, cashew serves as food. Elsewhere it forms a delicacy. The kernels are nutritious, containing fats, proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals. In Brazil, Mozambique and Indonesia, the cashew apple is also important; it is eaten fresh or mixed in fruit salads, and a drink is prepared from the juice; sweets and jams can also be prepared from it. Young shoots and leaves are eaten fresh or cooked. | Fodder: The cake remaining after oil has been extracted from the kernel serves as animal food. Seed coats are used as poultry feed. | NA | NA"

Kraft pulping tests give a low yield of 54%, with a Kappa number of 71 and low brightness. | Timber: C. odorata is a lightweight and comparatively soft wood. The heartwood is pale creamy immediately after sawing, turning pinkish-brown upon exposure, and is clearly demarcated from the narrow band of sapwood. Heartwood is rated as moderately durable and moderately resistant to termites, but the sapwood is susceptible to staining and powder post beetles and is not durable. The density is 410-525 kg/cubic m at 12% mc. The grain is usually interlocked, sometimes straight or woolly, indicating the presence of tension wood; texture moderately fine to moderately coarse; the grain pattern is attractive in flat sown boards. Freshly cut wood has a distinct onionlike odour, which disappears after 2-3 days. It is easy to work, saws, bores, turns and sands without problems and produces a good finish; it is easy to glue. However, growth stresses may cause severe end splitting of logs and warping and splitting during saw milling. Tests in Samoa showed that the timber can be rotary peeled without pretreatment with good results, producing attractively patterned veneer; veneer slicing also gave good results. The wood is difficult to treat with preservatives, even by a pressure treatment. A premier timber for furniture, decorative veneer, musical instruments, wooden novelties and doors. The best known use of cedar timber is for cigar boxes, but it is also used for light construction, mouldings, cabinets, furniture, panelling, boxes, exterior joinery, weather boards, louvred doors, boat building (especially racing boats), canoes, musical instruments, turnery, matchboxes, household implements, face veneer and plywood.

As the floss is irritating to the eyes and nose, the tree is not recommended for town planting. | Medicine: Compressed fresh leaves are used against dizziness; decoction of the boiled roots is used to treat oedema; gum is eaten to relieve stomach upset; tender shoot decoction is a contraceptive and leaf infusion is taken orally against cough and hoarse throat. In Tamilnadu, India, the leaves are pounded together with fermented boiled rice water and the extract is administered to cows orally as a remedy for reproductive problems. The dose is approx. 500 ml three times a day for three consecutive days. | Fibre: The fibre from the inner wall of the fruit is unique in that it combines springiness and resilience and is resistant to vermin, to make it ideal for stuffing pillows, mattresses and cushions. It is light, water repellent and buoyant, making it ideal for life jackets, lifeboats and other naval safety apparatus. It is an excellent material for insulating iceboxes, refrigerators, cold-storage plants, offices, theatres and aeroplanes. It is a good sound absorber and is widely used for acoustic insulation; it is indispensable in hospitals, since mattresses can be dry sterilized without losing original quality. Practically the entire supply of kapok is obtained from Java. | Timber: C. pentandra wood is variable in colour, from white to light brown, but sap-staining fungi may darken it. The wood is very light, with specific gravity of0.25 g/cc. The wood machines easily but not satisfactorily. Machining characteristics include excellent planing and sanding and resistance to splitting when screwed. Shapes and bores poorly but mortises well. Logs and lumber are very susceptible to insect and fungal attack, but preservation treatment is easy; either pressure-vacuum systems or open-tank methods give good absorption and penetration. The wood is easy to peel for veneer. Reported uses of wood include plywood, packaging, lumber core stock, light construction, pulp and paper products, canoes and rafts, farm implements, furniture and matches. | Lipids: C. pentandra seed contains 20-25% non-drying oil, similar to cottonseed oil, used as a lubricant, in soap manufacturing and in cooking. | In Java, the tree is grown as a boundary tree and fences along roadsides. | Fodder: The pressed cake is a cattle feed containing about 26% protein. Sheep, goats and cattle relish the foliage. | Especies madeireiras de interesse comercial: lista com algumas das especies madeireiras mais comercializadas no Brasil, elaborada pela Equipe de Anatomia do Laboratório de Produtos Florestais do Serviço Florestal Brasileiro,  em 2010."

A good remedy for chronic catarrh and bronchitis, as it assists expectoration and is antiseptic; given with advantage in leucorrhoea, chronic cystitis, diarrhoea, and hemorrhoids. It is chiefly used in gonorrhea (though not advocated for chronic cases), often combined with other substances. It has also been recommended externally for chilblains. It is considered a valuable hydragogue diuretic in obstinate dropsy. The resin, not the oleoresin, is used as diuretic. This species is a folk remedy for dermatosis, eczema, and gonorrhea. In Panama, Yaviza negros mix cabismo resi with honey and give it to the newborns, to impart knowledge and ward off hexes. The gum is also used for treating venereal diseases and for massage. | Gum or resin: The oleoresin called copaiba is obtained by incising the trunk. The hydrocarbon is used as an emollient and for other non-energy-related purposes by the natives. The copal is used in lacquers, massage preparations, medicines, and paints. | Timber: The timber is highly resistant to natural decay caused by Gloeophyllum trabeum, Coriolus versicolor and Poria monticola. The wood is used in carpentry. | The balsamiferous wood, with density of 700-900 kg/cu m, burns readily, perhaps even when green. The hydrocarbon obtained from the trunk can be used directly by a diesel-powered car. | NA"

Texture moderately coarse but even; sawn rubberwood often shows black stripes with the inclusion of bark material, the result of poor tapping practices with damaged or removed cambium; in freshly sawn wood there is a characteristic and distinct smell of latex. The importance of the timber from the rubber plantations is now fully recognized, and in Southeast Asia it is planted solely for timber production. Most of the timber is used to manufacture furniture. Other uses include interior finish, moulding, e.g. for wall panelling, picture frames, drawer guides, cabinet and other handles, parquet flooring, many household utensils, blockboard cores, pallets, crates, coffins, veneer, and glue-laminated timber, e.g. for staircases and door and window components. Since the timber is only moderately durable when exposed to the elements, it should not be used for exterior purposes. | Lipids: Seeds are the source of para rubber seed oil. Boiling removes the poison and releases the oil, which can be used for illumination. Kernels (50-60% of the seed) contain semi-drying pale yellow oil used in soap making, paints and varnishes. | Rubberwood was formerly regarded as a byproduct of the rubber plantations and used for the production of charcoal or as fuelwood, for brick making, tobacco drying and rubber drying. | Although poisonous, seeds of rubber can be eaten as a famine food after processing, which involves prolonged soaking or boiling to remove the cyanic poisons. Some of the denser wild stands of rubber in the Amazon are said to be due to artificial enrichment by indigenous peoples to increase food supply. Seeds contain 40-50% oil, which dries well and is suitable for use as food and for technical purposes. | Fodder: Seeds are sometimes eaten off the ground by cattle. Press cake or extracted meal can be cautiously used as feed for stock. | NA"

Besides being used to give energy and stamina, jatob  tea has been used for centuries as a tonic for the respiratory and urinary systems by the indigenous people of the Amazon Basin. Jatob  is known for its ability to fight fungus and yeast such as Candida albicans. Macerated bark is used for diarrhoea. The bark, sap or resin, and leaves are used medicinally for cystitis, hepatitis, prostatitis and cough. The sap is used for coughs and bronchitis, and a bark tea is used for stomach problems as well as athlete?s foot and foot fungus. In Brazilian herbal medicine today, jatob  bark and resin are still recommended for the same indications and problems as they have been since the 1930s, documented to be tonic, stomachic, astringent, balsamic, vermifuge, and haemostatic. The fruit is used to treat mouth ulcers, and the leaves and wood are used for diabetes. | Gum or resin: The roots and trunk yield a pale yellow or red resinlike gum known commercially as South American copal. The gum exudes and forms hard lumps that become buried in the soil at the base of a tree. Sometimes as much as a barrel of gum has been | Timber: The hard, durable, tough wood is one of the best from the region. Heartwood is salmon pink to orange-brown when fresh, becoming russet to reddish-brown when seasoned; often marked with dark streaks. Sapwood is usually wide, white, grey, or pinkish. Texture is medium to rather coarse; grain mostly interlocked; golden lustre, without distinctive odour or taste. The wood is moderately difficult to saw and machine, largely because of its high density, but except in planing it can be machined to a smooth surface. It is easy to glue and finish satisfactorily. Wood very resistant to brown-rot and white-rot fungi. Heartwood is also rated very resistant to dry-wood termites; it has little resistance to marine borers. This important timber tree is used for furniture (sometimes compared with mahogany), carpentry, general construction, wheels and cogs, dugouts, shipbuilding, posts, looms, cartwheels and rail ties. The wood is also attractive for cabinetwork, musical instruments, interior trim, plywood, turnery, and veneer. | Seed pods contain an edible powdery pulp. This pulp contains 3.2% sugar, 1.1% fat, and 35.8% crude fibre. It has its own peculiar smell and sweet flavour, slightly reminiscent of bananas, and is generally considered pleasant but not very attractive. The texture is that of dry flour turning to a paste in the mouth, and some people find this unpleasant. It is very dry and largely starchy, so it is a good source of calories. Jatoba bark tea is a quite popular drink for lumberjacks working in the forests in Brazil, because it is a natural energy tonic. | Fodder: The pods and leaves are not eaten. The seeds and pulp are removed from the pod, ground and readily consumed by livestock."

Ripe berries are often cut and used fresh or dried in floral displays. The tree has been grown as an indoor bonsai. | Shade or shelter: The wide, multibranched crown provides good shade and acts as a suitable windbreak. | Poison: The hanging strings of little pink berries of this attractive ornamental tree are reputed to be moderately poisonous, particularly the seed. Leaves are an insect repellant. The pollen, on contact or when inhaled, can cause dermatitis and asthmatic reactions. The tree also has antimicrobial, antifungal, piscicidal and viricidal properties. | Medicine: Leaf juice is used to treat ophthalmia and rheumatism; a bark extract infusion is used for diarrhoea, and resin of the bark is a dangerous purgative. Other known medicinal properties of the tree include using it as an astringent, a balsamic, diuretic, expectorant, masticatory, stomachic, tonic and vulnerary. The ailments it is known to treat include amenorrhoea, bronchitis, gingivitis, gonorrhoea, gout, tuberculosis, tumour, ulcer, urethritis, wart, wounds, and urogenital and venereal diseases. | Alcohol: An intoxicating liquor known as ?copalocle? or ?copalote? is obtained by fermenting the fruit with pulque for 1-2 days. | Gum or resin: The tree produces an aromatic resin used as a mastic. | Latex or rubber: Latex is produced from many parts of the tree. | Timber: Heartwood is a dull, light red, deepening upon exposure and becoming more or less purplish and rather oily looking; distinct but not sharply demarcated from the brownish-grey sapwood; moderately hard and heavy, specific gravity (air-dry)0.54-0.68; texture medium to fine, uniform; grain variable, often irregular; very easy to work; durability high; wood is termite resistant and therefore suitable for posts. | Essential oil: The fruit contains a volatile oil and has a flavour resembling that of a mixture of fennel and pepper. The oil of S. molle exhibits significant activity against several bacterial species, such as Alcaligenes faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae | The wood of S. molle can be burned as both firewood and charcoal. | It is sometimes planted as a live fence. | While not considered poisonous, the berries are not normally eaten. In Mexico, the fruit is ground and mixed with other substances to form beverages. The seeds are sometimes used to adulterate pepper. | NA"

Plant extracts exhibit antibacterial properties, and a decoction of the bark or root bark is considered antiseptic. The roots are regarded as febrifugal, and leaf decoctions used for colds, fevers and gonorrhoea. | Fibre: Its hardness, density and light colour make it useful for wood pulp. The resulting paper has good resistance to tension and tearing but a poor reaction to folding. | Timber: The heartwood is cream to buff in colour and is not distinguishable from the sapwood. Lustre is medium; texture medium to coarse; grain straight to slightly irregular. The wood is easy to work and generally finishes smoothly; fuzzy grain may develop in some operations. The trunks are occasionally used for dugouts and the stems for posts, boxes, matches, general carpentry, tool handles, millwork, utility plywood, and furniture components. Logs need to be promptly processed to minimize deterioration from insect attack. | The wood is suitable for firewood. | Trees can be planted close together to make live fences. | The pulp of the fruit is sometimes eaten directly, especially when found in the forest, but is too acid to be considered attractive; it can also be boiled or dried. It is especially used for syrup, ice cream, drinks and jellies. Juices improve with keeping overnight as the mild astringency of the fresh fruit disappears. Fermented products are also good. About half of the fruit weight is pulp, which is 8% water, 10% sugars, 1-8% fibre, and0.4% ash. The sugars give about 40 calories/100 g. The fruit is a good source of vitamins A and C; vitamin C quantities vary between 34 and 54 mg/g, and carotenoids are presumably present in reasonable concentrations. There is great variation in fruit quality from region to region, some being sweet and pleasant and others quite disagreeable in flavour. When fresh water is unavailable, water from the roots of S. mombin can be drunk. The shoot tastes like cassava and can be eaten raw or boiled. The seeds can also be eaten. | Fodder: Pigs eat the whole fruit as it falls to the ground. Leaves can be fed to cattle."
