"Field measurements of generation length are largely missing for Neotropical trees. Therefore, an approach based on tree functional types was used to set proxies of species generation lengths based on their growth form and ecological group. Values of the proxies ranged from 10 (for pioneer shrubs) to 80 years (large, climax trees), which are reasonable for tropical trees obtained using IUCN approximative method number 3 (IUCN 2019, p.29). This species was classified as ","More details on this approximate method to define species generation lengths can be found in Lima et al. (XXXX)."
