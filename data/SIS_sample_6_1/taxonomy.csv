22823,"<p>Phipps (1774) first described the Polar Bear as a distinct species and named it <em>Ursus maritimus</em>. Other names were suggested including <em>Thalassarctos, Thalarctos, and Thalatarctos. </em>Erdbrink (1953) and Thenius (1953) ultimately settled on <em>Ursus (Thalarctos) maritimus </em>because of interbreeding between Brown Bears (<em>Ursus arctos</em>) and Polar Bears in zoos. Based on the fossil record, Kurtén (1964) recommended the Phipps (1774) name <em>Ursus maritimus,</em> which was promoted by Harington (1966), Manning (1971) and Wilson (1976) and is used today (see DeMaster and Stirling 1981, Amstrup 2003, Wilson and Reeder 2005).</p>",MAMMALIA,URSIDAE,Ursus,,,,22823,ANIMALIA,CARNIVORA,CHORDATA,maritimus,"Phipps, 1774"
37583,"<em>Commidendrum&#160;</em>forms a monophyletic endemic genus with no very close affinities (Noyes and Reiseberg 1999).<br/><br/>The Gumwood (<em>Commidendrum robustum</em> (Roxb.) DC.) was split into two subspecies by Cronk (2000):<ul><li>subsp. robustum; all extant plants belong to this taxon.</li><li>subsp. gummiferum Cronk; this taxon was provisionally ascribed to confusing 19th Century specimens of uncertain identity, which had been formerly classified as <em>C. gummiferum</em> (Roxb.) DC.</li></ul><br/>Some of the specimens labelled as <em>C. gummiferum</em> lie within the range of variation exhibited by <em>C. robustum</em> subsp. <em>robustum</em>. The remainder certainly belong to a distinct taxon, but their classification as a subspecies is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental differences in flower and inflorescence structure from subsp. <em>robustum</em>. In fact, they are somewhat closer to the False Gumwood (<em>C. spurium</em> (G.Forst) DC.). For this reason, the current treatment restores <em>C. gummiferum</em> as a species, though uncertainties persist over its true position, and there is a strong possibility that it may be a hybrid between the two surviving parents.<br/><br/>The well-defined <em>C. robustum</em> is thus retained as a species concept without division at subspecific level. Subspecies <em>gummiferum </em>has been promoted to species level under <em>C. gummiferum</em>, along with the Red List assessment done by Q. Cronk in 1998.",MAGNOLIOPSIDA,COMPOSITAE,Commidendrum,,,,37583,PLANTAE,ASTERALES,TRACHEOPHYTA,robustum,(Roxb.) DC.
60344,"<p>Other <em>Anguilla</em> species have occasionally been stocked in Europe, but none have established a self-sustaining population. Pure <em>A. rostrata</em>&#160;(American Eel) have been recorded, likely due to stocking attempts, but are relatively rare (Böetius 1976). DNA analysis is the best tool to distinguish between European Eels and other species, and <em>A. rostrata</em> have fewer vertebrae than <em>A. anguilla</em> (102-112, usually 106-108, vs. 111-119, usually 114-116). Hybrids are known to have been found in Iceland where pure <em>A.&#160;rostrata</em> and <em>A.&#160;anguilla</em>&#160;also exist (Albert <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p>",ACTINOPTERYGII,ANGUILLIDAE,Anguilla,,,,60344,ANIMALIA,ANGUILLIFORMES,CHORDATA,anguilla,"(Linnaeus, 1758)"
