The resinous juice of seeds is used for mental derangement, heart palpitation, rheumatism; it was used to cure the loss of memory that was a sequel to smallpox. | Alcohol: In Brazil, Mozambique and Indonesia cashew wine (slightly fermented juice) is enjoyed at harvest time and can be distilled to produce strong alcoholic drinks.

It is considered beneficial in pulmonary complaints, cases of leucorrhea, indigestion, and allegedly tightens the teeth where the gums are diseased. In Belize, it is taken as an antidote for snakebite. In Guyana, the pounded bark is poulticed on wounds. Mexicans apply the pulverized bark on ulcers. | Alcohol: The fruits are often used to prepare an acid, oily, fermented beverage known by the standard term chicha applied to assorted beer-like drinks made of fruits or maize. By distillation, a rum-like liquor called Crema de nance is produced in Costa R | Fibre: The bark yields a strong fiber. | Timber: The sapwood is greyish, the heartwood reddish-brown, heavy, coarse-textured, tough, and highly prized for boat ribs though it is brittle and only medium-durable. It is usually available only in small sizes and is used for tool handles, turnery, cabinetwork, furniture and small-scale construction. | Lipids: An edible fat is extracted from the fruits with boiling water in Magdalena, Colombia. B. crassifolia flowers produce abundant lipids instead of nectar. Several species of Centris bees collect this oil. | In Brazil, the wood is chosen for the hot fire over which people smoke the stimulant paste of guaran  (Paullinia cupana) because the burning wood has a pleasant odour. In some areas it is used for making charcoal. | The fruits are eaten raw or cooked as dessert, or may be included in soup or in stuffing for meats. The fruits are often used to prepare carbonated beverages.","medicinal",3,NA,"true","false",NA,"true","sp479"
